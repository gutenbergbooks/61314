<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_NOTICE" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTICE">INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.</a>
<br />
1868.</h2>


<p>I am about to do what very few could do without emotion&mdash;revise
a book which I wrote forty-five years ago. This little
work came out in the Augustan days of Edinburgh, when Jeffrey
and Scott, Wilson and the Ettrick Shepherd, Dugald Stewart and
Alison, were daily giving the productions of their minds to the
public, and while yet Archibald Constable acted as the unquestioned
emperor of the publishing world. I was then an insignificant
person of the age of twenty; yet, destitute as I was both of means
and friends, I formed the hope of writing something which would
attract attention. The subject I proposed was one lying readily
at hand, the romantic things connected with Old Edinburgh. If,
I calculated, a first <em>part</em> or <em>number</em> could be issued, materials for
others might be expected to come in, for scores of old inhabitants,
even up perhaps to the very ‘oldest,’ would then contribute their
reminiscences.</p>

<p>The plan met with success. Materials almost unbounded came
to me, chiefly from aged professional and mercantile gentlemen,
who usually, at my first introduction to them, started at my
youthful appearance, having formed the notion that none but an
old person would have thought of writing such a book. A friend
gave me a letter to Mr Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, who, I was
told, knew the scandal of the time of Charles II. as well as he did
the merest gossip of the day, and had much to say regarding the
good society of a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Looking back from the year 1868, I feel that C. K. S. has
himself become, as it were, a tradition of Edinburgh. His thin
effeminate figure, his voice pitched <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in alt</i>&mdash;his attire, as he took
his daily walks on Princes Street, a long blue frock-coat, black
trousers, rather wide below, and sweeping over white stockings
and neat shoes&mdash;something like a web of white cambric round his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
neck, and a brown wig coming down to his eyebrows&mdash;had long
established him as what is called a character. He had recently
edited a book containing many stories of diablerie, and another in
which the original narrative of ultra-presbyterian church history
had to bear a series of cavalier notes of the most mocking character.
He had a quaint biting wit, which people bore as they would a
scratch from a provoked cat. Essentially, he was good-natured,
and fond of merriment. He had considerable gifts of drawing,
and one caricature portrait by him, of Queen Elizabeth dancing,
‘high and disposedly,’ before the Scotch ambassadors, is the delight
of everybody who has seen it. In jest upon his own peculiarity of
voice, he formed an address-card for himself consisting simply of
the following anagram:</p>

<div class="figcenter w400">
<img src="images/illus_p_vi.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi dicitur</i> C sharp. He was intensely aristocratic, and cared
nothing for the interests of the great multitude. He complained
that one never heard of any gentlefolks committing crimes nowadays,
as if that were a disadvantage to them or the public. Any
case of a Lady Jane stabbing a perjured lover would have delighted
him. While the child of whim, Mr Sharpe was generally believed
to possess respectable talents by which, with a need for exerting
them, he might have achieved distinction. His ballad of the
‘Murder of Caerlaverock,’ in the <cite>Minstrelsy</cite>, is a masterly production;
and the concluding verses haunt one like a beautiful strain
of music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘To sweet Lincluden’s haly cells</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Fu’ dowie I’ll repair;</div>
<div class="verse">There Peace wi’ gentle Patience dwells,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nae deadly feuds are there.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
<div class="verse">In tears I’ll wither ilka charm,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Like draps o’ balefu’ yew;</div>
<div class="verse">And wail the beauty that cou’d harm</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A knight sae brave and true.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After what I had heard and read of Charles Sharpe, I called
upon him at his mother’s house, No. 93 Princes Street, in a somewhat
excited frame of mind. His servant conducted me to the
first floor, and showed me into what is generally called amongst us
the back drawing-room, which I found carpeted with green cloth,
and full of old family portraits, some on the walls, but many more
on the floor. A small room leading off this one behind, was the
place where Mr Sharpe gave audience. Its diminutive space was
stuffed full of old curiosities, cases with family bijouterie, &amp;c.
One petty object was strongly indicative of the man&mdash;a calling-card
of Lady Charlotte Campbell, the once adored beauty, stuck
into the frame of a picture. He must have kept it at that time
about thirty years. On appearing, Mr Sharpe received me very
cordially, telling me he had seen and been pleased with my first
two numbers. Indeed, he and Sir Walter Scott had talked together
of writing a book of the same kind in company, and calling
it <cite>Reekiana</cite>, which plan, however, being anticipated by me, the
only thing that remained for him was to cast any little matters of
the kind he possessed into my care. I expressed myself duly
grateful, and took my leave. The consequence was the appearance
of notices regarding the eccentric Lady Anne Dick, the beautiful
Susanna, Countess of Eglintoune, the Lord Justice-clerk Alva, and
the Duchess of Queensberry (the ‘Kitty’ of Prior), before the close
of my first volume. Mr Sharpe’s contributions were all of them
given in brief notes, and had to be written out on an enlarged
scale, with what I thought a regard to literary effect as far as the
telling was concerned.</p>

<p>By an introduction from Dr Chalmers, I visited a living lady
who might be considered as belonging to the generation at the
beginning of the reign of George III. Her husband, Alexander
Murray, had, I believe, been Lord North’s Solicitor-general for
Scotland. She herself, born before the Porteous Riot, and well
remembering the Forty-five, was now within a very brief space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
of the age of a hundred. Although she had not married in her
earlier years, her children, Mr Murray of Henderland and others,
were all elderly people. I found the venerable lady seated at a
window in her drawing-room in George Street, with her daughter,
Miss Murray, taking the care of her which her extreme age
required, and with some help from this lady, we had a conversation
of about an hour. She spoke with due reverence of her
mother’s brother, the Lord Chief-justice Mansfield, and when I
adverted to the long pamphlet against him written by Mr Andrew
Stuart at the conclusion of the Douglas Cause, she said that, to
her knowledge, he had never read it, such being his practice in
respect of all attacks made upon him, lest they should disturb his
equanimity in judgment. As the old lady was on intimate terms
with Boswell, and had seen Johnson on his visit to Edinburgh&mdash;as
she was the sister-in-law of Allan Ramsay the painter, and had
lived in the most cultivated society of Scotland all her long life&mdash;there
were ample materials for conversation with her; but her
small strength made this shorter and slower than I could have
wished. When we came upon the <em>poet</em> Ramsay, she seemed to
have caught new vigour from the subject: she spoke with animation
of the child-parties she had attended in his house on the
Castle-hill during a course of ten years before his death&mdash;an event
which happened in 1757. He was ‘charming,’ she said; he
entered so heartily into the plays of children. He, in particular,
gained their hearts by making houses for their dolls. How
pleasant it was to learn that our great pastoral poet was a man
who, in his private capacity, loved to sweeten the daily life of his
fellow-creatures, and particularly of the young! At a warning
from Miss Murray, I had to tear myself away from this delightful
and never-to-be-forgotten interview.</p>

<p>I had, one or two years before, when not out of my teens,
attracted some attention from Sir Walter Scott by writing for
him and presenting (through Mr Constable) a transcript of the
songs of the <cite>Lady of the Lake</cite>, in a style of peculiar calligraphy,
which I practised for want of any better way of attracting
the notice of people superior to myself. When George IV.
some months afterwards came to Edinburgh, good Sir Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
remembered me, and procured for me the business of writing
the address of the Royal Society of Edinburgh to His Majesty,
for which I was handsomely paid. Several other learned bodies
followed the example, for Sir Walter Scott was the arbiter of
everything during that frantic time, and thus I was substantially
benefited by his means.</p>

<p>According to what Mr Constable told me, the great man liked
me, in part because he understood I was from Tweedside. On
seeing the earlier numbers of the <cite>Traditions</cite>, he expressed
astonishment as to ‘where the boy got all the information.’
But I did not see or hear from him till the first volume had
been completed. He then called upon me one day, along with
Mr Lockhart. I was overwhelmed with the honour, for Sir
Walter Scott was almost an object of worship to me. I literally
could not utter a word. While I stood silent, I heard him
tell his companion that Charles Sharpe was a writer in the
<cite>Traditions</cite>, and taking up the volume, he read aloud what he
called one of his <em>quaint bits</em>. ‘The ninth Earl of Eglintoune
was one of those patriarchal peers who live to an advanced
age&mdash;indefatigable in the frequency of their marriages and the
number of their children&mdash;who linger on and on, with an unfailing
succession of young countesses, and die at last leaving a
progeny interspersed throughout the whole of Douglas’s <cite>Peerage</cite>,
two volumes, folio, re-edited by Wood.’ And then both gentlemen
went on laughing for perhaps two minutes, with interjections:
‘How like Charlie!’&mdash;‘What a strange being he is!’&mdash;‘<em>Two
volumes, folio, re-edited by Wood</em>&mdash;ha, ha, ha! There you
have him past all doubt;’ and so on. I was too much abashed
to tell Sir Walter that it was only an impudent little bit of writing
of my own, part of the solution into which I had diffused the
actual notes of Sharpe. But, having occasion to write next
day to Mr Lockhart, I mentioned Sir Walter’s mistake, and he
was soon after good enough to inform me that he had set his
friend right as to the authorship, and they had had a <em>second</em>
hearty laugh on the subject.</p>

<p>A very few days after this visit, Sir Walter sent me, along
with a kind letter, a packet of manuscript, consisting of sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
folio pages, in his usual close handwriting, and containing all
the reminiscences he could at the time summon up of old
persons and things in Edinburgh. Such a treasure to me!
And such a gift from the greatest literary man of the age to the
humblest! Is there a literary man of the present age who
would scribble as much for any humble aspirant? Nor was this
the only act of liberality of Scott to me. When I was preparing
a subsequent work, <cite>The Popular Rhymes of Scotland</cite>, he sent me
whole sheets of his recollections, with appropriate explanations.
For years thereafter he allowed me to join him in his walks
home from the Parliament House, in the course of which he
freely poured into my greedy ears anything he knew regarding
the subjects of my studies. His kindness and good-humour on
these occasions were untiring. I have since found, from his
journal, that I had met him on certain days when his heart was
overladen with woe. Yet his welcome to me was the same.
After 1826, however, I saw him much less frequently than before,
for I knew he grudged every moment not spent in thinking and
working on the fatal tasks he had assigned to himself for the
redemption of his debts.</p>

<p>All through the preparation of this book, I was indebted a good
deal to a gentleman who was neither a literary man nor an artist
himself, but hovered round the outskirts of both professions, and
might be considered as a useful adjunct to both. Every votary
of pen or pencil amongst us knew David Bridges at his drapery
establishment in the Lawnmarket, and many had been indebted
to his obliging disposition. A quick, dark-eyed little
man, with lips full of sensibility and a tongue unloving of rest,
such a man in a degree as one can suppose Garrick to have
been, he held a sort of court every day, where wits and painters
jostled with people wanting coats, jerkins, and spotted handkerchiefs.
The place was small, and had no saloon behind;
so, whenever David had got some ‘bit’ to show you, he dragged
you down a dark stair to a packing-place, lighted only by a
grate from the street, and there, amidst plaster-casts numberless,
would fix you with his glittering eye, till he had convinced you of
the fine handling, the ‘buttery touches’ (a great phrase with him),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
the admirable ‘scummling’ (another), and so forth. It was in
the days prior to the Royal Scottish Academy and its exhibitions;
and it was left in a great measure to David Bridges to bring
forward aspirants in art. Did such a person long for notice,
he had only to give David one of his best ‘bits,’ and in a short
time he would find himself chattered into fame in that profound,
the grate of which I never can pass without recalling something
of the buttery touches of those old days. The Blackwood wits,
who laughed at everything, fixed upon our friend the title of
‘Director-general of the Fine Arts,’ which was, however, too
much of a truth to be a jest. To this extraordinary being I
had been introduced somehow, and, entering heartily into my
views, he brought me information, brought me friends, read and
criticised my proofs, and would, I dare say, have written the
book itself if I had so desired. It is impossible to think of
him without a smile, but at the same time a certain melancholy,
for his life was one which, I fear, proved a poor one for himself.</p>

<p>Before the <cite>Traditions</cite> were finished, I had become favourably
acquainted with many gentlemen of letters and others, who were
pleased to think that Old Edinburgh had been chronicled.
Wilson gave me a laudatory sentence in the <cite>Noctes Ambrosianæ</cite>.
The Bard of Ettrick, viewing my boyish years, always spoke of
and to me as an unaccountable sort of person, but never could
be induced to believe otherwise than that I had written all my
traditions from my own head. I had also the pleasure of
enjoying some intercourse with the venerable Henry Mackenzie,
who had been born in 1745, but always seemed to feel as if the
<cite>Man of Feeling</cite> had been written only one instead of sixty years
ago, and as if there was nothing particular in antique occurrences.
The whole affair was pretty much of a triumph at the
time. Now, when I am giving it a final revision, I reflect with
touched feelings, that all the brilliant men of the time when it
was written are, without an exception, passed away, while, for
myself, I am forced to claim the benefit of Horace’s humanity:</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_TO_PRESENT_ISSUE" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_PRESENT_ISSUE">INTRODUCTION TO PRESENT ISSUE.</a></h2>


<p>It has been very shrewdly remarked by a famous essayist and
critic that a book is none the worse for having survived a
generation or two. Robert Chambers’s <cite>Traditions of Edinburgh</cite>
has survived many generations since its first appearance in 1825,
and I have before me a copy of this edition in the original six
parts, published at two shillings each, the first of which aroused in
Sir Walter Scott so much interest. The work when completed
appears to have passed through many reprints, but retained its
original form until it was remodelled and almost rewritten in
1846, much new matter being then added, and certain passages
altogether omitted. Shortly before his death the author again
revised the work, adding a new introduction, in which he
reviewed the changes of the preceding forty years. This was in
1868, and since that time old Edinburgh has almost ceased
to exist. Many an ancient wynd and close has disappeared,
or remains simply as a right of way, on all sides surrounded
by modern buildings. The City Improvements Act, obtained
by Dr William Chambers when Lord Provost of Edinburgh
in 1865 and again in 1868, swept away hundreds of old buildings;
and to it is due the disappearance of Leith Wynd, St
Mary’s Wynd, Blackfriars Wynd, the Ancient Scottish Mint in
the Cowgate, and other landmarks more or less familiar to our
grandfathers. These changes are confined not alone to the old
town of Edinburgh, but extend to other districts which at the
beginning of the nineteenth century were comparatively modern
and fashionable. Brown Square and the buildings adjoining it
known as ‘the Society’ have passed away, being intersected by the
modern Chambers Street. Adam Square, adjoining the College,
has been absorbed in South Bridge Street; Park Street and Park
Place, where was once a fashionable boarding-school for young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
ladies, have disappeared to make room for the M’Ewan Hall and
other University buildings.</p>

<p>If it is true that the old town of Edinburgh has been modernised
out of existence, the remark applies equally to its immediate
suburbs. Indeed the all-round changes of the last forty years can
fitly be compared to like changes which within the same period
have taken place in the city of Rome. Until within very recent
times Edinburgh bore some slight resemblance to the Rome of the
Popes, with its stately villas and great extent of walled-in garden
ground. Much of this aristocratic old-world aspect has passed
away, and one can but lament the disappearance of many an
eighteenth-century house and grounds, interesting in not a few
cases as the former residence of a citizen whose memory extended
back to the Edinburgh of Sir Walter Scott and the famous men
who were his contemporaries and friends.</p>

<p>Falcon Hall on the south side of the town, with its great
gardens and walled-in parks, has disappeared. So also has the
interesting villa of Abbey Hill, occupied until very recent times
by the Dowager Lady Menzies. The Clock Mill House adjoining
Holyrood Palace and the Duke’s Walk, and surrounded by ancient
trees, has gone, as have likewise the many fine old residences with
pleasant gardens which adjoined the two main roads between
Edinburgh and Leith. All have passed away, giving place to rows
of semi-detached villas and endless lines of streets erected for the
housing of an ever-increasing population.</p>

<p>One of the few surviving examples of the old Scotch baronial
mansion is Coates House, standing within the grounds of St Mary’s
Episcopal Cathedral at the west end of the city. This house was
occupied by Robert Chambers for several years prior to his removal
to St Andrews in 1840. It has since been modernised, and is now
used for various purposes in connection with the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Although Robert Chambers died so long ago as 1871, no
adequate story of his life has since been attempted. This is a
matter for regret in view of some comparatively recent discoveries,
particularly those relating to the history of the authorship of
that famous work, <cite>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</cite>,
made public for the first time in 1884. Of that work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">{xv}</a></span>
written between the years 1841-44, in the solitude of Abbey
Park, St Andrews, a recent writer has said: ‘This book was
almost as great a source of wonder in its time as the <cite>Letters of
Junius</cite>, or <cite>Waverley</cite> itself. The learning and common-sense of
the book, its rare temperateness and common-sense, commanded
immediate attention. It was the wonder of the world at that
period, nor was the authorship ever acknowledged, I believe.’
The mystery is now solved; but be it said that in the opinion of
many Robert Chambers is more interesting as an antiquary than
a scientist. It is in the former capacity that his name will be
handed down to posterity as author of the standard work on the
tradition and antiquities of the Scottish capital. The outstanding
feature of the present issue of the <cite>Traditions</cite> is the series of
original drawings which have been provided by Mr James
Riddel, R.S.W., and it is hoped they will enable the reader more
readily to realise the city’s old world charm, so sympathetically
described by Robert Chambers. While a few notes have been
added to this edition, it has not been deemed advisable to alter
the text, and therefore that fact must be borne in mind where
dates and lapses of time are mentioned.</p>

<p>Edinburgh was, at the beginning of George III.’s reign, a
picturesque, odorous, inconvenient, old-fashioned town, of
about seventy thousand inhabitants. It had no court, no factories,
no commerce; but there was a nest of lawyers in it, attending
upon the Court of Session; and a considerable
number of the Scotch gentry&mdash;one of
whom then passed as rich with a thousand
a year&mdash;gave it the benefit of
their presence during the winter.
Thus the town had lived for some
ages, during which political
discontent and division had
kept the country poor. A
stranger approaching the city,
seeing it piled ‘close and
massy, deep and high’&mdash;a
series of towers, rising from
a palace on the plain to a
castle in the air&mdash;would have
thought it a truly romantic
place; and the impression
would not have subsided much
on a near inspection, when he
would have found himself
admitted by a fortified gate
through an ancient wall, still
kept in repair. Even on entering the one old street of which
the city chiefly consisted, he would have seen much to admire&mdash;houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
of substantial architecture and lofty proportions, mingled
with more lowly, but also more arresting wooden fabrics; a huge
and irregular, but venerable Gothic church, surmounted by an
aërial crown of masonry; finally, an esplanade towards the Castle,
from which he could have looked abroad upon half a score of
counties, upon firth and fell, yea, even to the blue Grampians.
Everywhere he would have seen symptoms of denseness of
population; the open street a universal market; a pell-mell of
people everywhere. The eye would have been, upon the whole,
gratified, whatever might be the effect of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clangor strepitusque</i>
upon the ear, or whatever might have been the private
meditations of the nose. It would have only been on coming
to close quarters, or to quarters at all, that our stranger would
have begun to think of serious drawbacks from the first impression.
For an inn, he would have had the White Horse, in
a close in the Canongate; or the White Hart, a house which
now appears like a carrier’s inn, in the Grassmarket. Or, had
he betaken himself to a private lodging, which he would have
probably done under the conduct of a ragged varlet, speaking
more of his native Gaelic than English, he would have had to
ascend four or five stories of a common stair, into the narrow
chambers of
some Mrs
Balgray or
Luckie Fergusson,
where
a closet-bed
in the sitting-room
would
have been
displayed as
the most comfortable
place
in the world;
and he would
have had, for
amusement, a
choice between
an extensive
view of house-tops from the window and the study of a
series of prints of the four seasons, a sampler, and a portrait of
the Marquis of Granby, upon the wall.</p>

<p>On being introduced into society, our stranger might have discovered
cause for content with his lodging on finding how poorly
off were the first people with respect to domestic accommodations.
I can imagine him going to tea at Mr Bruce of Kennet’s, in
Forrester’s Wynd&mdash;a country gentleman and a lawyer (not long
after raised to the bench), yet happy to live with his wife and
children in a house of fifteen pounds of rent, in a region of profound
darkness and mystery, now no more. Had he got into
familiar terms with the worthy lady of the mansion, he might
have ascertained that they had just three rooms and a kitchen;
one room, ‘my lady’s’&mdash;that is, the kind of parlour he was
sitting in; another, a consulting-room for the gentleman; the
third, a bedroom. The children, with their maid, had beds
laid down for them at night in their father’s room; the housemaid
slept under the kitchen dresser; and the one man-servant
was turned at night out of the house. Had our friend chanced
to get amongst tradespeople, he might have found Mr Kerr,
the eminent goldsmith in the Parliament Square, stowing his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i> into a couple of small rooms above his booth-like shop,
plastered against the wall of St Giles’s Church; the nursery
and kitchen, however, being placed in a cellar under the level
of the street, where the children are said to have rotted off
like sheep.</p>

<p>But indeed everything was on a homely and narrow scale. The
College&mdash;where Munro, Cullen, and Black were already making
themselves great names&mdash;was to be approached through a mean
alley, the College Wynd. The churches were chiefly clustered
under one roof; the jail was a narrow building, half-filling up
the breadth of the street; the public offices, for the most part,
obscure places in lanes and dark entries. The men of learning
and wit, united with a proportion of men of rank, met as the
<em>Poker Club</em> in a tavern, the best of its day, but only a dark house
in a close, to which our stranger could scarcely have made his
way without a guide. In a similar situation across the way, he
would have found, at the proper season, the <em>Assembly</em>; that is,
a congregation of ladies met for dancing, and whom the gentlemen
usually joined rather late, and rather merry. The only theatre
was also a poor and obscure place in some indescribable part of the
Canongate.</p>

<p>The town was, nevertheless, a funny, familiar, compact, and not
unlikable place. Gentle and semple living within the compass of
a single close, or even a single stair, knew and took an interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
each other.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Acquaintances might not only be formed, Pyramus-and-Thisbe
fashion, through party-walls, but from window to
window across alleys, narrow enough in many cases to allow of
hand coming to hand, and even lip to lip. There was little
elegance, but a vast amount of cheap sociality. Provokingly
comical clubs, founded each upon one joke, were abundant. The
ladies had tea-drinkings at the primitive hour of six, from which
they cruised home under the care of a lantern-bearing, patten-shod
lass; or perhaps, if a bad night, in Saunders Macalpine’s sedan-chair.
Every forenoon, for several hours, the only clear space
which the town presented&mdash;that around the Cross&mdash;was crowded
with loungers of all ranks, whom it had been an amusement to
the poet Gay to survey from the neighbouring windows of Allan
Ramsay’s shop. The jostle and huddlement was extreme everywhere.
Gentlemen and ladies paraded along in the stately attire
of the period; tradesmen chatted in groups, often bareheaded,
at their shop-doors; caddies whisked about, bearing messages,
or attending to the affairs of strangers; children filled the kennel
with their noisy sports. Add to all this, corduroyed men from
Gilmerton, bawling coals or yellow sand, and spending as much
breath in a minute as could have served poor asthmatic Hugo
Arnot for a month; fishwomen crying their caller haddies from
Newhaven; whimsicals and idiots going along, each with his or
her crowd of listeners or tormentors; sootymen with their bags;
town-guardsmen with their antique Lochaber axes; water-carriers
with their dripping barrels; barbers with their hair-dressing
materials; and so forth&mdash;and our stranger would have been
disposed to acknowledge that, though a coarse and confused, it
was a perfectly unique scene, and one which, once contemplated,
was not easily to be forgotten.</p>

<p>A change at length began. Our northern country had settled
to sober courses in the reign of George II., and the usual results
of industry were soon apparent. Edinburgh by-and-by felt much
like a lady who, after long being content with a small and inconvenient
house, is taught, by the money in her husband’s pockets,
that such a place is no longer to be put up with. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
wish to expatiate over some of the neighbouring grounds, so as
to get more space and freer air; only it was difficult to do, considering
the physical circumstances of the town, and the character
of the existing outlets. Space, space!&mdash;air, air! was, however,
a strong and a general cry, and the old romantic city did at
length burst from its bounds, though not in a very regular way,
or for a time to much good purpose.</p>

<p>A project for a new street on the site of Halkerston’s Wynd,
leading by a bridge to the grounds of Mutrie’s Hill, where a
suburb might be erected, was formed before the end of the
seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was a subject of speculation to John,
Earl of Mar, during his years of exile, as were many other schemes
of national improvement which have since been realised&mdash;for
example, the Forth and Clyde Canal. The grounds to the north
lay so invitingly open that the early formation of such a project
is not wonderful. Want of spirit and of means alone could delay
its execution. After the Rebellion of 1745, when a general spirit
of improvement began to be shown in Scotland, the scheme was
taken up by a public-spirited provost, Mr George Drummond,
but it had to struggle for years with local difficulties. Meanwhile,
a sagacious builder, by name James Brown, resolved to take
advantage of the growing taste; he purchased a field near the
town for £1200, and <em>feued</em> it out for a square. The speculation
is said to have ended in something like giving him his own money
as an annual return. This place (George Square) became the
residence of several of the judges and gentry. I was amused a
few years ago hearing an old gentleman in the country begin
a story thus: ‘When I was in Edinburgh, in the year ’67, I went
to George Square, to call for Mrs Scott of Sinton,’ &amp;c. To this
day some relics of gentry cling to its grass-green causeways,
charmed, perhaps, by its propinquity to the Meadows and Bruntsfield
Links. Another place sprang into being, a smaller quadrangle
of neat houses, called Brown’s Square.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So much was
thought of it at first that a correspondent of the <cite>Edinburgh
Advertiser</cite>, in 1764, seriously counsels his fellow-citizens to erect
in it an equestrian statue of the then popular young king, George
III.! This place, too, had some distinguished inhabitants; till
1846, one of the houses continued to be nominally the town
mansion of a venerable judge, Lord Glenlee. We pass willingly
from these traits of grandeur to dwell on the fact of its having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
been the residence of Miss Jeanie Elliot of Minto, the authoress
of the original song, <cite>The Flowers of the Forest</cite>; and even to
bethink ourselves that here Scott placed the ideal abode of
Saunders Fairford and the adventure of Green Mantle. Sir
Walter has informed us, from his own recollections, that the
inhabitants of these southern districts formed for a long time a
distinct class of themselves, having even places of polite amusement
for their own recreation, independent of the rest of Edinburgh.
He tells us that the society was of the first description, including,
for one thing, most of the gentlemen who wrote in the <cite>Mirror</cite>
and the <cite>Lounger</cite>. There was one venerable inhabitant who did
not die till half the New Town was finished, yet he had never
once seen it!</p>

<p>The exertions of Drummond at length procured an act (1767)
for extending the royalty of the city over the northern fields;
and a bridge was then erected to connect these with the elder
city. The scheme was at first far from popular. The exposure
to the north and east winds was felt as a grievous disadvantage,
especially while houses were few. So unpleasant even was the
North Bridge considered that a lover told a New-Town mistress&mdash;to
be sure only in an epigram&mdash;that when he visited her, he
felt as performing an adventure not much short of that of Leander.
The aristocratic style of the place alarmed a number of pockets,
and legal men trembled lest their clients and other employers
should forget them if they removed so far from the centre of
things as Princes Street and St Andrew Square. Still, the move
was unavoidable, and behoved to be made.</p>

<p>It is curious to cast the eye over the beautiful city which now
extends over this district, the residence of as refined a mass of
people as could be found in any similar space of ground upon
earth, and reflect on what the place was a hundred years ago.
The bulk of it was a farm, usually called Wood’s Farm, from its
tenant (the father of a clever surgeon, well known in Edinburgh
in the last age under the familiar appellation of <em>Lang Sandy
Wood</em>). Henry Mackenzie, author of the <cite>Man of Feeling</cite>, who
died in 1831, remembered shooting snipes, hares, and partridges
about that very spot to which he alludes at the beginning of the
paper on Nancy Collins in the <cite>Mirror</cite> (July 1779): ‘As I walked
one evening, about a fortnight ago, <em>through St Andrew Square</em>, I
observed a girl meanly dressed,’ &amp;c. Nearly along the line now
occupied by Princes Street was a rough enclosed road, called the
<em>Lang Gait</em> or <em>Lang Dykes</em>, the way along which Claverhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
went with his troopers in 1689, when he retired in disgust from
the Convention, with the resolution of raising a rebellion in the
Highlands. On the site of the present Register House was a
hamlet or small group of houses called <em>Mutrie’s Hill</em>; and where
the Royal Bank now stands was a cottage wherein ambulative
citizens regaled themselves with fruit and curds and cream.
Broughton, which latterly has been surprised and swamped by
the spreading city, was then a village, considered as so far afield
that people went to live in it for the summer months, under the
pleasing idea that they had got into the country. It is related
that Whitefield used to preach to vast multitudes on the spot
which by-and-by became appropriated for the <em>Theatre Royal</em>.
Coming back one year, and finding a playhouse on the site of his
tub, he was extremely incensed. Could it be, as Burns suggests,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘There was rivalry just in the job!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>James Craig, a nephew of the poet Thomson, was entrusted with
the duty of planning the new city. In the engraved plan, he
appropriately quotes from his uncle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘August, around, what PUBLIC WORKS I see!</div>
<div class="verse">Lo, stately streets! lo, squares that court the breeze!</div>
<div class="verse">See long canals and deepened rivers join</div>
<div class="verse">Each part with each, and with the circling main,</div>
<div class="verse">The whole entwined isle.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The names of the streets and squares were taken from the royal
family and the tutelary saints of the island. The honest citizens
had originally intended to put their own local saint in the foreground;
but when the plan was shown to the king for his
approval, he cried: ‘Hey, hey&mdash;what, what&mdash;<em>St Giles Street!</em>&mdash;never
do, never do!’ And so, to escape from an unpleasant
association of ideas, this street was called <em>Princes Street</em>, in honour
of the king’s two sons, afterwards George IV. and the Duke of
York. So difficult was it at the very first to induce men to
build that a premium of twenty pounds was offered by the
magistrates to him who should raise the first house; it was
awarded to Mr John Young, on account of a mansion erected by
him in Rose Court, George Street. An exemption from burghal
taxes was granted to the first house in the line of Princes Street,
built by Mr John Neale, haberdasher (afterwards occupied by
Archibald Constable, and then as the Crown Hotel), in consequence
of a bargain made by Mr Graham, plumber, who sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
this and the adjoining ground to the town.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr Shadrach Moyes,
when having a house built for himself in Princes Street, in 1769,
took the builder bound to rear another farther along besides his,
to shield him from the west wind! Other quaint particulars are
remembered; as, for instance: Mr Wight, an eminent lawyer,
who had planted himself in St Andrew Square, finding he was in
danger of having his view of St Giles’s clock shut up by the
advancing line of Princes Street, built the intervening house
himself, that he might have it in his power to keep the roof low
for the sake of the view in question; important to him, he said,
as enabling him to regulate his movements in the morning, when
it was necessary that he should be punctual in his attendance at
the Parliament House.</p>

<p>The foundation was at length laid of that revolution which has
ended in making Edinburgh a kind of double city&mdash;<em>first</em>, an
ancient and picturesque hill-built one, occupied chiefly by the
humbler classes; and <em>second</em>, an elegant modern one, of much
regularity of aspect, and possessed almost as exclusively by the
more refined portion of society. The New Town, keeping pace
with the growing prosperity of the country, had, in 1790, been
extended to Castle Street; in 1800 the necessity for a second
plan of the same extent still farther to the north had been felt,
and this was after acted upon. Forty years saw the Old Town
thoroughly changed as respects population. One after another,
its nobles and gentry, its men of the robe, its ‘writers,’ and even
its substantial burghers, had during that time deserted their
mansions in the High Street and Canongate, till few were left.
Even those modern districts connected with it, as St John Street,
New Street, George Square, &amp;c., were beginning to be forsaken
for the sake of more elegantly circumstanced habitations beyond
the North Loch. Into the remote social consequences of this
change it is not my purpose to enter, beyond the bare remark
that it was only too accordant with that tendency of our present
form of civilisation to separate the high from the low, the intelligent
from the ignorant&mdash;that dissociation, in short, which would
in itself run nigh to be a condemnation of all progress, if we
were not allowed to suppose that better forms of civilisation are
realisable. Enough that I mention the tangible consequences of
the revolution&mdash;a flooding in of the humbler trading classes where
gentles once had been; the houses of these classes, again, filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
with the vile and miserable. Now were to be seen hundreds of
instances of such changes as Provost Creech indicates in 1783:
‘The Lord Justice-Clerk Tinwald’s house possessed by a French
teacher&mdash;Lord President Craigie’s house by a rouping-wife or
salewoman of old furniture&mdash;and Lord Drummore’s house left by
a chairman for want of accommodation.’ ‘The house of the Duke
of Douglas at the Union, now possessed by a wheelwright!’ To
one who, like myself, was young in the early part of the present
century, it was scarcely possible, as he permeated the streets and
closes of ancient Edinburgh, to realise the idea of a time when
the great were housed therein. But many a gentleman in middle
life, then living perhaps in Queen Street or Charlotte Square,
could recollect the close or the common stair where he had been
born and spent his earliest years, now altogether given up to a
different portion of society. And when the younger perambulator
inquired more narrowly, he could discover traces of this former
population. Here and there a carved coat-armorial, with supporters,
perhaps even a coronet, arrested attention
amidst the obscurities of some
<em>wynd</em> or court. Did he ascend a stair
and enter a floor, now subdivided
perhaps into four or five distinct
dwellings, he might readily perceive,
in the massive wainscot
of the lobby, a proof that
the refinements of life had
once been there. Still more
would this idea be impressed
upon him when, passing into
one of the best rooms of the
old house, he would find not
only a continuation of such
wainscoting, but perhaps a
tolerable landscape by Norie
on a panel above the fireplace,
or a ceiling decorated
by De la Cour, a French
artist, who flourished in
Edinburgh about 1740. Even yet he would discover a very few
relics of gentry maintaining their ground in the Old Town, as if
faintly to show what it had once been. These were generally old
people, who did not think it worth while to make any change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
till the great one. There is a melancholy pleasure in recalling
what I myself found about 1820, when my researches for this
work were commenced. In that year I was in the house of
Governor Fergusson, an ancient gentleman of the Pitfour family,
in a floor, one stair up, in the Luckenbooths. About the same
time I attended the book-sale of Dr Arrot, a physician of good
figure, newly deceased, in the Mint Close. For several years later,
any one ascending a now miserable-looking stair in Blackfriars
Wynd would have seen a door-plate inscribed with the name
<span class="smcap">Miss Oliphant</span>, a member of the Gask family. Nay, so late as
1832, I had the pleasure of breakfasting with Sir William Macleod
Bannatyne in Whiteford House, Canongate (afterwards a type-foundry),
on which occasion the venerable old gentleman talked
as familiarly of the levees of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-ministre</i> for Lord Bute in the
old villa at the Abbey Hill as I could have talked of the affairs
of the Canning administration; and even recalled, as a fresh
picture of his memory, his father drawing on his boots to go
to make interest in London in behalf of some of the men in
trouble for the Forty-five, particularly his own brother-in-law,
the Clanranald of that day. Such were the connections recently
existing between the past system of things and the present. Now,
alas! the sun of Old-Town glory has set for ever. Nothing is
left but the decaying and rapidly diminishing masses of ancient
masonry, and a handful of traditionary recollections, which be
it my humble but not unworthy task to transmit to future
generations.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Hugo Arnot&mdash;Allan Ramsay&mdash;House of the Gordon Family&mdash;Sir
David Baird&mdash;Dr Webster&mdash;House of Mary de Guise.</strong></p>


<p>The saunter which I contemplate through the streets and
stories, the lanes and legends, of Old Edinburgh may
properly commence at the Castle-hill, as it is a marked extremity
of the city as well as its highest ground.</p>

<p>The Castle-hill is partly an esplanade, serving as a parade-ground
for the garrison of the Castle, and partly a street, the
upper portion of that vertebral line which, under the various
names of Lawnmarket, High Street, and Canongate, extends to
Holyrood Palace. The open ground&mdash;a scene of warfare during
the sieges of the fortress, often a place of execution in rude
times&mdash;the place, too, where, by a curious legal fiction, the Nova
Scotia baronets were enfeoffed in their ideal estates on the other
side of the Atlantic&mdash;was all that Edinburgh possessed as a
readily accessible promenade before the extension of the city.
We find the severe acts for a strict observance of the Sabbath,
which appeared from time to time in the latter part of the
seventeenth and early part of the eighteenth century, denouncing
the King’s Park, the Pier of Leith, and the <em>Castle-hill</em> as the
places chiefly resorted to for the profane sport of walking on
‘the Lord’s Day.’ Denounce as they might, human nature could
never, I believe, be altogether kept off the Castle-hill; even the
most respectable people walked there in multitudes during the
intervals between morning and evening service. We have an
allusion to the promenade character of the Castle-hill in Ramsay’s
city pastoral, as it may be called, of <cite>The Young Laird and
Edinburgh Katy</cite>&mdash;</p>

<p>A memory of these Sunday promenadings here calls me to
introduce what I have to say regarding a man of whom there
used to be a strong popular remembrance in Edinburgh.</p>


<h3>HUGO ARNOT.</h3>

<p>The cleverly executed <cite>History of Edinburgh</cite>, published by
Arnot in 1779, and which to this day has not been superseded,
gives some respectability to a name which tradition would have
otherwise handed down to us as only that of an eccentric gentleman,
of remarkably scarecrow figure, and the subject of a few
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</i>.</p>

<p>He was the son of a Leith shipmaster, named Pollock, and
took the name of Arnot from a small inheritance in Fife. Many
who have read his laborious work will be little prepared to hear
that it was written when the author was between twenty and
thirty; and that, antiquated as his meagre figure looks in Kay’s
Portraits, he was at his death, in 1786, only thirty-seven. His
body had been, in reality, made prematurely old
by a confirmed asthma, accompanied by a cough,
which he himself said would carry him off like a
rocket some day, when a friend remarked, with
reference to his known latitudinarianism: ‘Possibly,
Hugo, in the contrary direction.’</p>

<div class="figcenter w150">
<img src="images/illus_p_012.jpg" width="150" height="427" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hugo Arnot, looking
so like his meat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Most of the jokes about poor Hugo’s person
have been frequently printed&mdash;as Harry Erskine
meeting him on the street when he was gnawing
at a spelding or dried haddock, and congratulating
him on <em>looking so like his meat</em>; and his
offending the piety of an old woman who was
cheapening a Bible in Creech’s shop, by some
thoughtless remark, when she first burst out
with: ‘Oh, you monster!’ and then turning
round and seeing him, added: ‘And he’s an
anatomy too!’ An epigram by Erskine is less
known:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The Scriptures assure us that much is forgiven</div>
<div class="verse"><em>To flesh and to blood</em> by the mercy of Heaven;</div>
<div class="verse">But I’ve searched the whole Bible, and texts can find none</div>
<div class="verse">That extend the assurance <em>to skin and to bone</em>.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Arnot was afflicted by a constitutional irritability to an extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
which can hardly be conceived. A printer’s boy, handing papers
to him over his shoulder, happened to touch his ear with one
of them, when he started up in a rage, and demanded of the
trembling youth what he meant by insulting him in that manner!
Probably from some quarrel arising out of this nervous weakness&mdash;for
such it really was&mdash;the Edinburgh booksellers, to a man,
refused to have anything to do with the prospectuses of his
<cite>Criminal Trials</cite>, and Arnot had to advertise that they were to
be seen in the coffee-houses, instead of the booksellers’ shops.</p>

<p>About the time when he entered at the bar (1772), he had a
fancy for a young lady named Hay (afterwards Mrs Macdougall),
sister of a gentleman who succeeded as Marquis of Tweeddale,
and then a reigning toast. One Sunday, when he contemplated
making up to his divinity on the Castle-hill, after forenoon
service, he entertained two young friends at breakfast in his
lodgings at the head of the Canongate. By-and-by the affairs
of the toilet came to be considered. It was then found that
Hugo’s washerwoman had played false, leaving him in a total
destitution of clean linen, or at least of clean linen that was also
<em>whole</em>. A dreadful storm took place, but at length, on its
calming a little, love found out a way, by taking the hand-ruffles
of one cast garment, in connection with the front of another,
and adding both to the body of a third. In this eclectic form
of shirt the meagre young philosopher marched forth with his
friends, and was rewarded for his perseverance by being allowed
a very pleasant chat with the young lady on ‘the hill.’ His
friends standing by had their own enjoyment in reflecting what
the beauteous Miss Hay would think if she knew the struggles
which her admirer had had that morning in preparing to make
his appearance before her.</p>

<p>Arnot latterly dwelt in a small house at the end of the Meuse
Lane in St Andrew Street, with an old and very particular lady
for a neighbour in the upper-floor. Disturbed by the enthusiastic
way in which he sometimes rang his bell, the lady ventured to
send a remonstrance, which, however, produced no effect. This
led to a bad state of matters between them. At length a very
pressing and petulant message being handed in one day, insisting
that he should endeavour to call his servants <em>in a different
manner</em>, what was the lady’s astonishment next morning to hear
a pistol discharged in Arnot’s house! He was simply complying
with the letter of his neighbour’s request, by firing, instead of
ringing, as a signal for shaving-water.</p>

<h3>ALLAN RAMSAY.</h3>

<p>On the north side of the esplanade&mdash;enjoying a splendid view
of the Firth of Forth, Fife and Stirling shires&mdash;is the neat little
villa of Allan Ramsay, surrounded by its miniature pleasure-grounds.
The sober, industrious life of this exception to the
race of poets having resulted in a small competency,
he built this odd-shaped house in
his latter days, designing to enjoy in it
the Horatian quiet which he had so
often eulogised in his verse. The
story goes that, showing it soon
after to the clever Patrick, Lord
Elibank, with much fussy interest
in all its externals and
accommodations, he remarked
that the wags were already at
work on the subject&mdash;they
likened it to a goose-pie<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
(owing to the roundness of the
shape). ‘Indeed, Allan,’ said
his lordship, ‘now I see you in
it, I think the wags are not far
wrong.’</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Allan Ramsay’s Villa.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The splendid reputation of
Burns has eclipsed that of Ramsay
so effectually that this pleasing
poet, and, upon the whole,
amiable and worthy man, is now little regarded. Yet Ramsay
can never be deprived of the credit of having written the best
pastoral poem in the range of British literature&mdash;if even that be
not too narrow a word&mdash;and many of his songs are of great
merit.</p>

<p>Ramsay was secretly a Jacobite, openly a dissenter from the
severe manners and feelings of his day, although a very decent
and regular attender of the Old Church in St Giles’s. He
delighted in music and theatricals, and, as we shall see,
encouraged the Assembly. It was also no doubt his own taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
which led him, in 1725, to set up a circulating library, whence
he diffused plays and other works of fiction among the people
of Edinburgh. It appears, from the private notes of the historian
Wodrow, that, in 1728, the magistrates, moved by some
meddling spirits, took alarm at the effect of this kind of reading
on the minds of youth, and made an attempt to put it down,
but without effect. One cannot but be amused to find amongst
these self-constituted guardians of morality Lord Grange, who
kept his wife in unauthorised restraint for several years, and
whose own life was a scandal to his professions. Ramsay, as is
well known, also attempted to establish a theatre in Edinburgh,
but failed. The following advertisement on this subject appears
in the <cite>Caledonian Mercury</cite>, September 1736: ‘The New
Theatre in Carrubber’s Close being in great forwardness, will be
opened the 1st of November. These are to advertise the
gentlemen and ladies who incline to purchase annual tickets, to
enter their names before the 20th of October next, on which day
they shall receive their tickets from Allan Ramsay, on paying
30s.&mdash;no more than forty to be subscribed for; after which none
will be disposed of under two guineas.’</p>

<p>The late Mrs Murray of Henderland knew Ramsay for the
last ten years of his life, her sister having married his son, the
celebrated painter. She spoke of him to me in 1825, with kindly
enthusiasm, as one of the most amiable men she had ever
known. His constant cheerfulness and lively conversational
powers had made him a favourite amongst persons of rank,
whose guest he frequently was. Being very fond of children, he
encouraged his daughters in bringing troops of young ladies
about the house, in whose sports he would mix with a patience
and vivacity wonderful in an old man. He used to give these
young friends a kind of ball once a year. From pure kindness
for the young, he would help to make dolls for them, and cradles
wherein to place these little effigies, with his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But
here a fashion of the age must be held in view; for, however
odd it may appear, it is undoubtedly true that to make and
dispose of dolls, such as children now alone are interested in,
was a practice in vogue amongst grown-up ladies who had little
to do about a hundred years ago.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span></p>
<p>Ramsay died in 1757. An elderly female told a friend of
mine that she remembered, when a girl, living as an apprentice
with a milliner in the Grassmarket, being sent to Ramsay
Garden to assist in making <em>dead-clothes</em> for the poet. She could
recall, however, no particulars of the scene but the roses
blooming in at the window of the death-chamber.</p>

<p>The poet’s house passed to his son, of the same name, eminent
as a painter&mdash;portrait-painter to King George III. and his queen&mdash;and
a man of high mental culture; consequently much a
favourite in the circles of Johnson and Boswell. The younger
Allan enlarged the house, and built three additional houses to
the eastward, bearing the title of Ramsay Garden. At his death,
in 1784, the property went to his son, General John Ramsay,
who, dying in 1845, left this mansion and a large fortune to Mr
Murray of Henderland. So ended the line of the poet. His
daughter Christian, an amiable, kind-hearted woman, said to possess
a gift of verse, lived for many years in New Street. At
seventy-four she had the misfortune to be thrown down by a
hackney-coach, and had her leg broken; yet she recovered, and
lived to the age of eighty-eight. Leading a solitary life, she
took a great fancy for cats. Besides supporting
many in her own house, curiously
disposed in bandboxes, with doors to go in
and out at, she caused
food to be laid out for
others on her stair and
around her house. Not a word of obloquy
would she listen to against the species, alleging,
when any wickedness of a cat was spoken
of, that the animal must have acted under provocation, for by
nature, she asserted, cats are harmless. Often did her maid go
with morning messages to her friends, inquiring, with her compliments,
after their pet cats. Good Miss Ramsay was also a
friend to horses, and indeed to all creatures. When
she observed a carter ill-treating his horse, she would
march up to him, tax him with cruelty, and, by
the very earnestness of her remonstrances, arrest
the barbarian’s hand. So also, when she saw one
labouring on the street, with the appearance of
defective diet, she would send
rolls to its master, entreating
him to feed the animal. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
peculiarities, although a little eccentric, are not unpleasing; and
I cannot be sorry to record them of the daughter of one whose
heart and head were an honour to his country.</p>

</div>

<p>[1868.&mdash;It seems to have been unknown to the biographers of
Allan Ramsay the painter that he made a romantic marriage. In
his early days, while teaching the art of drawing in the family of
Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick, one of the young ladies fell in
love with him, captivated probably by the tongue which afterwards
gave him the intimacy of princes, and was undoubtedly a
great source of his success in life. The father of the enamoured
girl was an old proud baronet; her mother, a sister of the Chief-Justice,
Earl of Mansfield. A
marriage with consent of parents
was consequently impossible. The
young people, nevertheless, contrived
to get themselves united in
wedlock.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Allan Ramsay’s Monument, Princes Street Gardens.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The speedily developed talent
of Ramsay, the illustrious patronage
they secured to him, and the
very considerable wealth which
he acquired must have in time
made him an acceptable relation
to those proud people. A
time came when their descendants
held the connection
even as an honour. The
wealth of the painter
ultimately, on the death
of his son
in 1845,
became the
property of
Mr Murray
of Henderland,
a
grandson of
Sir Alexander
Lindsay
and nephew
of Mrs Allan
Ramsay;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
thence it not long after passed to Mr Murray’s brother, Sir John
Archibald Murray, better known by his judicial name of Lord
Murray. This gentleman admired the poet, and resolved to
raise a statue to him beside his goose-pie house on the Castlehill;
but the situation proved unsuitable, and since his own
lamented death, in 1858, the marble full-length of worthy
Allan, from the studio of John Steell, has found a noble
place in the Princes Street Gardens, resting on a pedestal,
containing on its principal side a medallion portrait of Lord
Murray, on the reverse one of General Ramsay, on the
west side one of the General’s lady, and on the east similar
representations of the General’s two daughters, Lady Campbell
and Mrs Malcolm. Thus we find&mdash;owing to the esteem
which genius ever commands&mdash;the poet of the <cite>Gentle Shepherd</cite>
in the immortality of marble, surrounded by the figures
of relatives and descendants who so acknowledged their aristocratic
rank to be inferior to his, derived from mind alone.]</p>

<h3>HOUSE OF THE GORDON
FAMILY.</h3>

<p>Tradition points out, as the
residence of the Gordon family, a
house, or rather range of buildings,
situated between Blair’s and
Brown’s Closes, being almost the
first mass of building in the
Castle-hill Street on the right-hand
side. The southern portion
is a structure of lofty and massive
form, battlemented at top, and
looking out upon a garden which
formerly stretched down to the old
town-wall near the Grassmarket,
but is now crossed by the access
from the King’s Bridge.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> From
the style of building, I should be
disposed to assign it a date a little
subsequent to the Restoration.
There are, however, no authentic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
memorials respecting the alleged connection of the Gordon family
with this house,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> unless we are to consider as of that character a
coronet resembling that of a marquis, flanked by two deer-hounds,
the well-known supporters of this noble family, which figures over
a finely moulded door in Blair’s Close.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The coronet will readily
be supposed to point to the time when the <em>Marquis of Huntly</em>
was the principal honour of the family&mdash;that is, previous to 1684,
when the title of Duke of Gordon was conferred.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_18">Page 18.</a></span>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In more recent times, this substantial mansion was the abode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
Mr Baird of Newbyth; and here it was that the late gallant Sir
David Baird, the hero of Seringapatam, was born and brought up.
Returning in advanced life from long foreign service, this distinguished
soldier came to see the home of his youth on the Castle-hill.
The respectable individual whom I found occupying the
house in 1824 received his visitor with due respect, and after
showing him through the house, conducted him out to the garden.
Here the boys of the existing tenant were found actively engaged
in throwing cabbage-stalks at the tops of the chimneys of the
houses of the Grassmarket, situated a little below the level of the
garden. On making one plump down the vent, the youngsters
set up a great shout of triumph. Sir David fell a-laughing at
sight of this example of practical waggery, and entreated the
father of the lads ‘not to be too angry; he and his brother, when
living here at the same age, had indulged in precisely the same
amiable amusement, the chimneys then, as now, being so provokingly
open to such attacks that there was no resisting the
temptation.’</p>

<p>The whole matter might have been put into an axiomatic form&mdash;Given
a garden with cabbage-stalks, and a set of chimneys
situated at an angle of forty-five degrees below the spot, any boys
turned loose into the said garden will be sure to endeavour to
bring the cabbage-stalks and the chimneys into acquaintance.</p>


<h3>DR WEBSTER.</h3>

<p>An isolated house which formerly stood in Webster’s Close,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a
little way down the Castle-hill, was the residence of the Rev. Dr
Webster, a man eminent in his day on many accounts&mdash;a leading
evangelical clergyman in Edinburgh, a statist and calculator of
extraordinary talent, and a distinguished figure in festive scenes.
The first population returns of Scotland were obtained by him in
1755; and he was the author of that fund for the widows of the
clergy of the Established Church which has proved so great a
blessing to many, and still exists in a flourishing state.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
also deep in the consultations of the magistrates regarding the
New Town.</p>

<p>It is not easy to reconcile the two leading characteristics of this
divine&mdash;his being the pastor of a flock of noted sternness, called,
from the church in which they assembled, the <em>Tolbooth Whigs</em>;
and his at the same time entering heartily and freely into the
convivialities of the more mirthful portion of society. Perhaps
he illustrated the maxim that one man may steal horses with
impunity, &amp;c.; for it is related that, going home early one
morning with strong symptoms of over-indulgence upon him, and
being asked by a friend who met him ‘what the Tolbooth Whigs
would say if they were to see him at this moment,’ he instantly
replied: ‘They would not believe their own eyes.’ Sometimes he
did fall on such occasions under plebeian observation, but the
usual remark was: ‘Ah, there’s Dr Webster, honest man, going
hame, nae doubt, frae some puir afflicted soul he has been visiting.
Never does he tire o’ well-doing!’ And so forth.</p>

<p>The history of Dr Webster’s marriage is romantic. When a
young and unknown man, he was employed by a friend to act as
go-between, or, as it is termed in Scotland, black-fit, or black-foot,
in a correspondence which he was carrying on with a young lady
of great beauty and accomplishment. Webster had not acted
long in that character, till the young lady, who had never entertained
any affection for his constituent, fell deeply in love with
himself. Her birth and expectations were better than his; and
however much he might have been disposed to address her on his
own behalf, he never could have thought of such a thing so long
as there was such a difference between their circumstances. The
lady saw his difficulty, and resolved to overcome it, and that in
the frankest manner. At one of these interviews, when he was
exerting all his eloquence in favour of his friend, she plainly told
him that he would probably come better speed if he were to speak
for himself. He took the hint, and, in a word, was soon after
married to her. He wrote upon the occasion an amorous lyric,
which exhibits in warm colours the gratitude of a humble lover
for the favour of a mistress of superior station, and which is
perhaps as excellent altogether in its way as the finest compositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
of the kind produced in either ancient or modern times. There is
one particularly impassioned verse, in which, after describing a
process of the imagination by which, in gazing upon her, he comes
to think her a creature of more than mortal nature, he says that
at length, unable to contain, he clasps her to his bosom, and&mdash;</p>

<h3>HOUSE OF MARY DE GUISE.</h3>

<p>The restrictions imposed upon a city requiring defence appear
as one of the forms of misery leading to strange associations.
We become, in a special degree, sensible of this truth when we see
the house of a royal personage sunk amidst
the impurities of a narrow close in
the Old Town of Edinburgh.
Such was literally the
case of an aged pile of
buildings on the north
side of the Castle-hill,
behind the front line
of the street, and
accessible by Blyth’s,
Nairn’s, and Tod’s
Closes, which was declared
by tradition to
have been the residence
of Mary de Guise, the
widow of James V., and
from 1554 to 1560
regent of this realm.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450">
<img src="images/illus_p_022.jpg" width="450" height="472" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Ancient Pile of Buildings, North Side of Castle-Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Descending the first
of these alleys about
thirty yards, we came
to a dusky, half-ruinous
building on the left-hand
side, presenting one or two lofty windows and a doorway,
surrounded by handsome mouldings; the whole bearing that
appearance which says: ‘There is here something that has been
of consequence, all haggard and disgraced though it now be.’
Glancing to the opposite side of the close, where stood another
portion of the same building, the impression was confirmed by
further appearances of a goodly style of architecture. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
were, in reality, the principal portions of the palace of the
Regent Mary; the former being popularly described as her
<em>house</em>, the latter as her <em>oratory</em> or chapel. The close terminated
under a portion of the building; and when the visitor
made his way so far, he found an exterior presented northwards,
with many windows, whence of old a view must have been
commanded, first of the gardens descending to the North Loch,
and second, of the Firth of Forth and Fife. One could easily
understand that, when the gardens existed, the north side of the
house might have had many pleasant apartments, and been, upon
the whole, tolerable as a place of residence, albeit the access by a
narrow alley could never have been agreeable. Latterly the site
of the upper part of the garden was occupied by a brushmaker’s
workshops and yard, while the lower was covered by the Earthen
Mound. In the wall on the east side there was included, as a
mere portion of the masonry, a stray stone, which had once been
an architrave or lintel; it contained, besides an armorial device
flanked by the initials A. A., the legend <span class="smcap">Nosce Teipsum</span>, and the
date 1557.</p>

<p>Reverting to the door of the queen’s house, which was simply
the access of a common stair, we there found an ornamented
architrave, bearing the legend,</p>

<p class="center">
LAUS ET HONOR DEO,
</p>

<p>terminated by two pieces of complicated lettering, one much
obliterated, the other a monogram of the name of the Virgin
Mary, formed of the letters M. R.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Finally, at the extremities
of this stone, were two Roman letters of larger size&mdash;I. R.&mdash;doubtless
the initials of James Rex, for James V., the style of
cutting being precisely the same as in the initials seen on the
palace built by that king in Stirling Castle; an indirect proof, it
may be remarked, of this having been the residence of the Regent
Mary.</p>

<p>Passing up a spiral flight of steps, we came to a darksome lobby,
leading to a series of mean apartments, occupied by persons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
humblest grade. Immediately within the door was a small recess
in the wall, composed of Gothic stonework, and supposed by the
people to have been designed for containing holy-water, though
this may well be matter of doubt. Overhead, in the ceiling, was
a round entablature, presenting a faded coronet over the defaced
outline of a shield. A similar object adorned the ceiling of the
lobby in the second floor, but in better preservation, as the shield
bore three <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs de lis</i>, with the coronet above, and the letters
H. R. below. There was a third of these entablatures, containing
the arms of the city of Edinburgh, in the centre of the top
of the staircase. The only other curious object in this part
of the mansion was the door of one of the wretched apartments&mdash;a
specimen of carving, bearing all the appearance of
having been contemporary with the building, and containing,
besides other devices, bust portraits of a gentleman and lady.
This is now in the possession of the Society of the Antiquaries of
Scotland.</p>

<p>A portion of the same building, accessible by a stair nearer
the head of the close, contained a hall-like apartment, with other
apartments, all remarkable for their unusually lofty ceilings. In
the large room were the remains of a spacious decorated chimney,
to which, in the recollection of persons still living, there had been
attached a chain, serving to confine the tongs to their proper
domain. This was the memorial of an old custom, of which it is
not easy to see the utility, unless some light be held as thrown
upon it by a Scottish proverb, used when a child takes a thing
and says he found it: ‘You found it, I suppose, where the Highlandman
found the tongs.’ In the centre of almost all the
ceilings of this part of the mansion I found, in 1824, circular
entablatures, with coats of arms and other devices, in stucco,
evidently of good workmanship, but obscured by successive coats
of whitening.</p>

<p>The place pointed out by tradition as the queen-regent’s oratory
was in the first-floor of the building opposite&mdash;a spacious and lofty
hall, with large windows designed to make up for the obscurity of
the close. Here, besides a finely carved piscina, was a pretty
large recess, of Gothic structure, in the back-wall, evidently designed
for keeping things of importance. Many years ago, out of
the wall behind this recess, there had been taken a small iron box,
such as might have been employed to keep jewellery, but empty.
I was the means of its being gifted to Sir Walter Scott, who had
previously told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span> ‘a passion for such little boxes was one of
those that most did beset him;’ and it is now in the collection at
Abbotsford.</p>

<p>The other portions of the mansion, accessible from different
alleys, were generally similar to these, but somewhat finer. One
chamber was recognised as the <em>Deid-room</em>; that is, the room where
individuals of the queen’s establishment were kept between their
death and burial.</p>

<p>It was interesting to wander through the dusky mazes of this
ancient building, and reflect that they had been occupied three
centuries ago by a sovereign princess, and one of the most illustrious
lineage. Here was the substantial monument of a connection
between France and Scotland, a totally past state of things. She
whose ancestors owned Lorraine as a sovereignty, who had spent
her youth in the proud halls of the Guises in Picardy, and been
the spouse of a Longueville, was here content to live&mdash;in a <em>close</em>
in Edinburgh! In these obscurities, too, was a government
conducted, which had to struggle with Knox, Glencairn, James
Stewart, Morton, and many other powerful men, backed by a
popular sentiment which never fails to triumph. It was the
misfortune of Mary to be placed in a position to resist the
Reformation. Her own character deserved that she should have
stood in a more agreeable relation to what Scotland now venerates,
for she was mild and just, and sincerely anxious for the good of
her adopted country. It is also proper to remember on the present
occasion that ‘in her court she maintained a decent gravity, nor
would she tolerate any licentious practices therein. Her maids of
honour were always busied in commendable exercises, she herself
being an example to them in virtue, piety, and modesty.’<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When
all is considered, and we further know that the building was strong
enough to have lasted many more ages, one cannot but regret that
the palace of Mary de Guise, reduced as it was to vileness, should
not now be in existence. The site having been purchased by
individuals connected with the Free Church, the buildings were
removed in 1846 to make room for the erection of an academical
institution or college for the use of that body.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In a central part of Old Edinburgh&mdash;the very Little Britain of
our city&mdash;is a curious, angular, whimsical-looking street, of great
steepness and narrowness, called the West Bow. Serving as a
connection between the Grassmarket and Lawnmarket, between
the Low and the High Town, it is of considerable fame in our
city annals as a passage for the entry of sovereigns, and the scene
of the quaint ceremonials used on those occasions. In more
modern times, it has been chiefly notable in the recollections of
country-people as a nest of the peculiarly noisy tradesmen, the
white-iron smiths, which causes Robert Fergusson to mark, as one
of the features of Edinburgh deserted for a holiday:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The tinkler billies<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> o’ the Bow</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Another remarkable circumstance connected with the street in
the popular mind is its having been the residence of the famed
wizard, Major Weir. All of these particulars serve to make it a
noteworthy sort of place, and the impression is much favoured by
its actual appearance. A perfect Z in figure, composed of tall
antique houses, with numerous dovecot-like gables projecting over
the footway, full of old inscriptions and sculpturings, presenting
at every few steps some darksome lateral profundity, into which
the imagination wanders without hindrance or exhaustion, it
seems eminently a place of old grandmothers’ tales, and sure at all
times to maintain a ghost or two in its community. When I
descend into particulars, it will be seen what grounds there truly
are for such a surmise.</p>

<h3>THE BOWHEAD.</h3>

<p>This is a comparatively open space, though partially straightened
again by the insertion in it of a clumsy, detached old building
called the <em>Weigh-house</em>, where enormous masses of butter and
cheese are continually getting disposed of. Prince Charles had
his guard at the Weigh-house when blockading the Castle; using,
however, for this purpose, not the house itself, but a floor of the
adjacent tall tenement in the Lawnmarket, which appears to have
been selected on a very intelligible principle, in as far as it was
the deserted mansion of one of the city clergy, the same Rev.
George Logan who carried on a controversy with Thomas Ruddiman,
in which he took unfavourable views of the title of the
Stuart family to the throne, not only then, but at any time. It
was, no doubt, as an additional answer to a bad pamphlet that
the Highlanders took up their quarters at Mr Logan’s.</p>


<h3>ANDERSON’S PILLS.</h3>

<p>In this tall <em>land</em>, dated 1690, there is a house on the second-floor
where that venerable drug, Dr Anderson’s pills, is sold, and has
been so for above a century. As is well known, the country-people
in Scotland have to this day [1824] a peculiar reverence for these
pills, which are, I believe, really a good form of aloetic medicine.
They took their origin from a physician of the time of Charles I.,
who gave them his name. From his daughter, Lillias Anderson,
the patent came to a person designed Thomas Weir, who left
it to his daughter. The widow of this last person’s nephew,
Mrs Irving, is now the patentee; a lady of advanced age, who
facetiously points to the very brief series of proprietors intervening
between Dr Anderson and herself, as no inexpressive indication of
the virtue of the medicine. [Mrs Irving died in 1837, at the age
of ninety-nine.] Portraits of Anderson and his daughter are
preserved in this house: the physician in a Vandyke dress, with a
book in his hand; the lady, a precise-looking dame, with a pill in
her hand about the size of a walnut, saying a good deal for the
stomachs of our ancestors. The people also show a glove which
belonged to the learned physician.</p>

<p>[1868.&mdash;In 1829 Mrs Irving lived in a neat, self-contained
mansion in Chessels’s Court, in the Canongate, along with her son,
General Irving, and some members of his family. The old lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
then ninety-one, was good enough to invite me to dinner, when I
likewise found two younger sisters of hers, respectively eighty-nine
and ninety. She sat firm and collected at the head of the table,
and carved a leg of mutton with perfect propriety. She then told
me, at her son’s request, that in the year 1745, when Prince
Charles’s army was in possession of the town, she, a child of
four years, walked with her nurse to Holyrood Palace, and
seeing a Highland gentleman
standing in the
doorway, she went up to
him to examine his peculiar
attire. She even
took the liberty of lifting
up his kilt a little way;
whereupon her nurse,
fearing some danger,
started forward for her
protection. But the
gentleman only patted
her head, and said something
kind to her. I
felt it as very curious to
sit as guest with a person
who had mingled in
the Forty-five. But my
excitement was brought
to a higher pitch when,
on ascending to the
drawing-room, I found
the general’s daughter, a
pretty young woman recently married, sitting there, dressed in
a suit of clothes belonging to one of the nonagenarian aunts&mdash;a
very fine one of flowered satin, with elegant cap and lappets,
and silk shoes three inches deep in the heel&mdash;the same having
been worn by the venerable owner just seventy years before
at a Hunters’ Ball at Holyrood Palace. The contrast between
the former and the present wearer&mdash;the old lady shrunk and
taciturn, and her young representative full of life and resplendent
in joyous beauty&mdash;had an effect upon me which it would be
impossible to describe. To this day, I look upon the Chessels’s
Court dinner as one of the most extraordinary events in my
life.]</p>

<h3>ORATORIES&mdash;COLONEL GARDINER.</h3>

<p>This house presents a feature which forms a curious memorial
of the manners of a past age. In common with all the houses
built from about 1690 to 1740&mdash;a substantial class, still abundant
in the High Street&mdash;there is at the end of each row of windows
corresponding to a separate mansion, a narrow slit-like window,
such as might suffice for a closet. In reality, each of these narrow
apertures gives light to a small cell&mdash;much too small to require
such a window&mdash;usually entering from the dining-room or some
other principal apartment. The use of these cells was to serve as
a retreat for the master of the house, wherein he might perform
his devotions. The father of a family was in those days a sacred
kind of person, not to be approached by wife or children too
familiarly, and expected to be a priest in his own household.
Besides his family devotions, he retired to a closet for perhaps an
hour each day to utter his own prayers;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and so regular was the
custom that it gave rise, as we see, to this peculiarity in house-building.
Nothing could enable us more clearly to appreciate
that strong outward demonstration of religious feeling which pervaded
the nation for half a century after the agonies of ‘the
Persecution.’ I cannot help here mentioning the interest with
which I have visited Bankton House,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in East Lothian, where, as is
well known, Colonel Gardiner spent several years of his life. The
oratory of the pious soldier is pointed out by tradition, and it
forms even a more expressive memorial of the time than the closets
in the Edinburgh houses. Connected with a small front room,
which might have been a library or <em>study</em>, is a little recess, such
as dust-pans and brooms are kept in, consisting of the angular
space formed by a stair which passes overhead to the upper floor.
This place is wholly without light, yet it is said to have been the
place sacred to poor Gardiner’s private devotions. What leaves
hardly any doubt on the matter is that there has been a wooden
bolt within, capable only of being shot from the inside, and therefore
unquestionably used by a person desiring to shut himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
in. Here, therefore, in this darksome, stifling little cell, had this
extraordinary man spent hours in those devotional exercises by
which he was so much distinguished from his class.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>


<h3>BOWHEAD SAINTS&mdash;SEIZERS&mdash;A JACOBITE BLACKBIRD.</h3>

<p>In the latter part of the seventeenth century, the inhabitants of
the West Bow enjoyed a peculiar fame for their piety and zeal in
the Covenanting cause. The wits of the opposite faction are full
of allusions to them as ‘the Bowhead Saints,’ ‘the godly plants of
the Bowhead,’ and so forth. [This is the basis of an allusion by a
later Cavalier wit, when describing the exit of Lord Dundee from
Edinburgh, on the occasion of the settlement of the crown upon
William and Mary:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘As he rode down the sanctified bends of the Bow,</div>
<div class="verse">Ilka carline was flyting, and shaking her pow;</div>
<div class="verse">But some young plants of grace, that looked couthie and slie,</div>
<div class="verse">Said: “Luck to thy bonnet, thou bonnie Dundee!”’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is to be feared that Sir Walter has here shown a relenting
towards the ‘young plants,’ for which they would not have thanked
him.] All the writings of the wits of their own time speak of the
system to which they were opposed as one of unmitigated sternness.
It was in those days a custom to patrol the streets during
the time of divine service, and take into captivity all persons found
walking abroad; and indeed make seizure of whatever could be
regarded as guilty of Sabbath-breaking. It is said that, led by a
sneaking sense, the patrol one day lighted upon a joint of meat
in the course of being roasted, and made prize of it, leaving the
graceless owner to chew the spit. On another occasion, about the
year 1735, a capture of a different kind was made. ‘The people
about that time,’ says Arnot, ‘were in use to teach their birds to
chant the songs of their party. It happened that the blackbird
of an honest Jacobitical barber, which from his cage on the outside
of the window gave offence to the zealous Whigs by his songs,
was neglected, on a Saturday evening, to be brought within the
house. Next morning he tuned his pipe to the usual air, <em>The
king shall enjoy his own again</em>. One of the <em>seizers</em>, in his holy
zeal, was enraged at this manifestation of impiety and treason in
one of the feathered tribe. He went up to the house, seized the
bird and the cage, and with much solemnity lodged them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
City-Guard.’<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Pennycook, a burgess bard of the time, represents
the officer as addressing the bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Had ye been taught by me, a <em>Bowhead saint</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">You’d sung the Solemn League and Covenant,</div>
<div class="verse">Bessy of Lanark, or the Last Good-night;</div>
<div class="verse">But you’re a bird prelatic&mdash;that’s not right....</div>
<div class="verse">Oh could my baton reach the laverocks too,</div>
<div class="verse">They’re chirping <em>Jamie, Jamie</em>, just like you:</div>
<div class="verse">I hate vain birds that lead malignant lives,</div>
<div class="verse">But love the chanters to the Bowhead wives.’</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>MAJOR WEIR.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></h3>

<div class="figcenter w275">
<img src="images/illus_p_031.jpg" width="275" height="366" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Major Weir’s House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It must have been a sad scandal to this peculiar community
when Major Weir, one of their number, was found to have been
so wretched an example of human infirmity. The house
occupied by this man still exists, though in an altered shape,
in a little court accessible by a narrow passage near the first
angle of the street. His history
is obscurely reported; but it
appears that he was of a good
family in Lanarkshire, and had
been one of the ten thousand
men sent by the Scottish Covenanting
Estates in 1641 to
assist in suppressing the Irish
Papists. He became distinguished
for a life of peculiar
sanctity, even in an age when
that was the prevailing tone of
the public mind. According to
a contemporary account:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span> ‘His
garb was still a cloak, and somewhat
dark, and he never went
without his staff. He was a tall
black man, and ordinarily looked
down to the ground; <em>a grim
countenance, and a big nose</em>. At
length he became so notoriously
regarded among the Presbyterian strict sect, that if four met
together, be sure Major Weir was one. At private meetings he
prayed to admiration, which made many of that stamp court his
converse. He never married, but lived in a private lodging with
his sister, Grizel Weir. Many resorted to his house, to join him
and hear him pray; but it was observed that he could not officiate
in any holy duty without the black staff, or rod, in his hand, and
leaning upon it, which made those who heard him pray admire his
flood in prayer, his ready extemporary expression, his heavenly
gesture; so that he was thought more angel than man, and was
termed by some of the holy sisters ordinarily <em>Angelical Thomas</em>.’
Plebeian imaginations have since fructified regarding the staff, and
crones will still seriously tell how it could run a message to a shop
for any article which its proprietor wanted; how it could answer
the door when any one called upon its master; and that it used to
be often seen running before him, in the capacity of a link-boy, as
he walked down the Lawnmarket.</p>

<p>After a life characterised externally by all the graces of devotion,
but polluted in secret by crimes of the most revolting nature,
and which little needed the addition of wizardry to excite the horror
of living men, Major Weir fell into a severe sickness, which affected
his mind so much that he made open and voluntary confession of
all his wickedness. The tale was at first so incredible that the
provost, Sir Andrew Ramsay,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> refused for some time to take him
into custody. At length himself, his sister (partner of one of his
crimes), and his staff were secured by the magistrates, together
with certain sums of money, which were found wrapped up in rags
in different parts of the house. One of these pieces of rag being
thrown into the fire by a bailie, who had taken the whole in
charge, flew up the chimney, and made an explosion like a cannon.
While the wretched man lay in prison, he made no scruple to
disclose the particulars of his guilt, but refused to address himself
to the Almighty for pardon. To every request that he would
pray, he answered in screams: ‘Torment me no more&mdash;I am
tormented enough already!’ Even the offer of a Presbyterian
clergyman, instead of an established Episcopal minister of the city,
had no effect upon him. He was tried April 9, 1670, and being
found guilty, was sentenced to be strangled and burnt between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Edinburgh and Leith. His sister, who was tried at the same time,
was sentenced to be hanged in the Grassmarket. The execution
of the profligate major took place, April 14, at the place indicated
by the judge. When the rope was about his neck, to prepare
him for the fire, he was bid to say: ‘Lord, be merciful to me!’
but he answered as before: ‘Let me alone&mdash;I will not&mdash;I have
lived as a beast, and I must die as a beast!’ After he had dropped
lifeless in the flames, his stick was also cast into the fire; and,
‘whatever incantation was in it,’ says the contemporary writer
already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> ‘the persons present own that it gave rare
turnings, and was long a-burning, as also himself.’</p>

<p>The conclusion to which the humanity of the present age would
come regarding Weir&mdash;that he was mad&mdash;is favoured by some
circumstances; for instance, his answering one who asked if he
had ever seen the devil, that ‘the only feeling he ever had of him
was in the dark.’ What chiefly countenances the idea is the unequivocal
lunacy of the sister. This miserable woman confessed
to witchcraft, and related, in a serious manner, many things which
could not be true. Many years before, a fiery coach, she said,
had come to her brother’s door in broad day, and a stranger
invited them to enter, and they proceeded to Dalkeith. On the
way, another person came and whispered in her brother’s ear
something which affected him; it proved to be supernatural
intelligence of the defeat of the Scotch army at Worcester, which
took place that day. Her brother’s power, she said, lay in his
staff. She also had a gift for spinning above other women, but
the yarn broke to pieces in the loom. Her mother, she declared,
had been also a witch. ‘The secretest thing that I, or any of the
family could do, when once a mark appeared upon her brow, she
could tell it them, though done at a great distance.’ This mark
could also appear on her own forehead when she pleased. At the
request of the company present, ‘she put back her head-dress, and
seeming to frown, there was an exact horse-shoe shaped for nails
in her wrinkles, terrible enough, I assure you, to the stoutest
beholder.’<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> At the place of execution she acted in a furious
manner, and with difficulty could be prevented from throwing off
her clothes, in order to die, as she said, ‘with all the shame she
could.’</p>

<p>The treatise just quoted makes it plain that the case of Weir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
and his sister had immediately become a fruitful theme for the
imaginations of the vulgar. We there receive the following
story: ‘Some few days before he discovered himself, a gentlewoman
coming from the Castle-hill, where her husband’s niece
was lying-in of a child, about midnight perceived about the
Bowhead three women in windows shouting, laughing, and
clapping their hands. The gentlewoman went forward, till, at
Major Weir’s door, there arose, as from the street, a woman
about the length of two ordinary females, and stepped forward.
The gentlewoman, not as yet excessively feared, bid her maid
step on, if by the lantern they could see what she was; but
haste what they could, this long-legged spectre was still before
them, moving her body with a vehement cachinnation and great
unmeasurable laughter. At this rate the two strove for place,
till the giantess came to a narrow lane in the Bow, commonly
called the Stinking Close, into which she turning, and the gentlewoman
looking after her, perceived the close full of flaming
torches (she could give them no other name), and as if it had
been a great number of people stentoriously laughing, and gaping
with tahees of laughter. This sight, at so dead a time of night,
no people being in the windows belonging to the close, made
her and her servant haste home, declaring all that they saw to
the rest of the family.’</p>

<p>For upwards of a century after Major Weir’s death, he continued
to be the bugbear of the Bow, and his house remained
uninhabited. His apparition was frequently seen at night, flitting,
like a black and silent shadow, about the street. His house,
though known to be deserted by everything human, was sometimes
observed at midnight to be full of lights, and heard to
emit strange sounds, as of dancing, howling, and, what is
strangest of all, spinning. Some people occasionally saw the
major issue from the low close at midnight, mounted on a black
horse without a head, and gallop off in a whirlwind of flame.
Nay, sometimes the whole of the inhabitants of the Bow would
be roused from their sleep at an early hour in the morning by
the sound as of a coach and six, first rattling up the Lawnmarket,
and then thundering down the Bow, stopping at the
head of the terrible close for a few minutes, and then rattling
and thundering back again&mdash;being neither more nor less than
Satan come in one of his best equipages to take home the major
and his sister, after they had spent a night’s leave of absence in
their terrestrial dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p>About fifty years ago, when the shades of superstition began
universally to give way in Scotland, Major Weir’s house came to
be regarded with less terror by the neighbours, and an attempt
was made by the proprietor to find a person who should be bold
enough to inhabit it. Such a person was procured in William
Patullo, a poor man of dissipated habits, who, having been at
one time a soldier and a traveller, had come to disregard in a
great measure the superstitions of his native country, and was
now glad to possess a house upon the low terms offered by the
landlord, at whatever risk. Upon its being known that Major
Weir’s house was about to be reinhabited, a great deal of curiosity
was felt by people of all ranks as to the result of the experiment;
for there was scarcely a native of the city who had not felt, since
his boyhood, an intense interest in all that concerned that awful
fabric, and yet remembered the numerous terrible stories which
he had heard respecting it. Even before entering upon his
hazardous undertaking, William Patullo was looked upon with
a flattering sort of interest, similar to that which we feel respecting
a regiment on the march to active conflict. It was the hope of
many that he would be the means of retrieving a valuable
possession from the dominion of darkness. But Satan soon let
them know that he does not tamely relinquish any of the outposts
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>On the very first night after Patullo and his spouse had taken
up their abode in the house, as the worthy couple were lying
awake in their bed, not unconscious of a certain degree of fear&mdash;a
dim, uncertain light proceeding from the gathered embers of
their fire, and all being silent around them&mdash;they suddenly saw
a form like that of a calf, which came forward to the bed, and,
setting its forefeet upon the stock, looked steadfastly at the
unfortunate pair. When it had contemplated them thus for a
few minutes, to their great relief it at length took itself away,
and, slowly retiring, gradually vanished from their sight. As
might be expected, they deserted the house next morning; and
for another half-century no other attempt was made to embank
this part of the world of light from the aggressions of the world
of darkness.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that, at no very remote time, there
were several houses in the Old Town which had the credit of
being haunted. It is said there is one at this day in the Lawnmarket
(a flat), which has been shut up from time immemorial.
The story goes that one night, as preparations were making for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
a supper-party, something occurred which obliged the family, as
well as all the assembled guests, to retire with precipitation, and
lock up the house. From that night it has never once been
opened, nor was any of the furniture withdrawn: the very goose
which was undergoing the process of being roasted at the time
of the occurrence is still at the fire! No one knows to whom
the house belongs; no one ever inquires after it; no one living
ever saw the inside of it; it is a condemned house! There is
something peculiarly dreadful about a house under these circumstances.
What sights of horror might present themselves if it
were entered! Satan is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimus hæres</i> of all such unclaimed
property!</p>

<p>Besides the many old houses that are haunted, there are several
endowed with the simple credit of having been the scenes of
murders and suicides. Some contain rooms which had particular
names commemorative of such events, and these names, handed
down as they had been from one generation to another, usually
suggested the remembrance of some dignified Scottish families,
probably the former tenants of the houses. There is a common-stair
in the Lawnmarket which was supposed to be haunted by
the ghost of a gentleman who had been mysteriously killed,
about a century ago, in open daylight, as he was ascending to
his own house: the affair was called to mind by old people on
the similar occasion of the murder of Begbie. A deserted house
in Mary King’s Close (behind the Royal Exchange) is believed
by some to have met with that fate for a very fearful reason.
The inhabitants of a remote period were, it is said, compelled
to abandon it by the supernatural appearances which took place
in it on the very first night after they had made it their residence.
At midnight, as the goodman was sitting with his wife by the
fire reading his Bible, and intending immediately to go to bed,
a strange dimness which suddenly fell upon his light caused him
to raise his eyes from the book. He looked at the candle, and
saw it burning blue. Terror took possession of his frame.
Turning away his eyes, there was, directly before him, and
apparently not two yards off, the head as of a dead person,
looking him straight in the face. There was nothing but a head,
though that seemed to occupy the precise situation in regard to
the floor which it might have done had it been supported by
a body of the ordinary stature. The man and his wife fainted
with terror. On awaking, darkness pervaded the room. Presently
the door opened, and in came a hand holding a candle. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
came and stood&mdash;that is, the body supposed to be attached to
the hand stood&mdash;beside the table, whilst the terrified pair saw
two or three couples of feet skip along the floor, as if dancing.
The scene lasted a short time, but vanished quite away upon
the man gathering strength to invoke the protection of Heaven.
The house was of course abandoned, and remained ever afterwards

<h3>TULZIES.</h3>

<p>At the Bowhead there happened, in the year 1596, a combat
between James Johnston of Westerhall and a gentleman of the
house of Somerville, which is thus related in that curious book,
the <cite>Memorie of the Somervilles</cite>.</p>

<p>‘The other actione wherein Westerhall was concerned happened
three years thereftir in Edinburgh, and was only personal on the
same account, betwext Westerhall and Bread (Broad) Hugh
Somervill of the Writes. This gentleman had often formerly
foughten with Westerhall upon equal termes, and being now in
Edinburgh about his privat affaires, standing at the head of the
West Bow, Westerhall by accident comeing up the same, some
officious and unhappy fellow says to Westerhall: “There is
Bread Hugh Somervill of the Writes.” Whereupon Westerhall,
fancying he stood there either to waitt him, or out of contempt,
he immediately marches up with his sword drawen, and with the
opening of his mouth, crying: “Turne, villane;” he cuttes
Writes in the hint head a deep and sore wound, the foullest
stroak that ever Westerhall was knoune to give, acknowledged
soe, and much regrated eftirwards by himself. Writes finding
himself strucken and wounded, seeing Westerhall (who had not
offered to double his stroak), drawes, and within a short tyme
puttes Westerhall to the defensive part; for being the taller man,
and one of the strongest of his time, with the advantage of the
hill, he presses him sore. Westerhall reteires by little, traverseing
the breadth of the Bow, to gain the advantage of the ascent,
to supply the defect of nature, being of low stature, which Writes
observeing, keepes closse to him, and beares him in front, that
he might not quyte what good-fortune and nature had given him.
Thus they continued neer a quarter of ane hour, clearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
callsay,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> so that in all the strait Bow there was not one to be
seen without their shop doores, neither durst any man attempt
to red them, every stroak of their swords threatening present
death both to themselves and others that should come neer
them. Haveing now come from the head of the Bow neer to
the foot thereof, Westerhall being in a pair of black buites,
which for ordinary he wore closse drawen up, was quyte tyred.
Therefore he stepes back within a shop doore, and stood upon
his defence. The very last stroak that Writes gave went neer
to have brocken his broad sword in peaces, haveing hitt the
lintell of the door, the marke whereof remained there a long
tyme. Thereftir, the toune being by this tyme all in ane uproar,
the halbertiers comeing to seaze upon them, they wer separated
and privatly convoyed to ther chambers. Ther wounds but
slight, except that which Writes had upon his head proved very
dangerous; for ther was many bones taken out of it; however,
at lenth, he was perfectly cured, and the parties themselves,
eftir Hugh Lord Somerville’s death, reconcealled, and all injuries
forgotten.’</p>

<p>In times of civil war, personal rencontres of this kind, and
even skirmishes between bands of armed men&mdash;usually called
tulzies&mdash;were of no unfrequent occurrence upon the streets of
Edinburgh. They abounded during the troublous time of the
minority of James VI. On the 24th of November 1567, the
Laird of Airth and the Laird of Wemyss met upon the High
Street, and, together with their followers, fought a bloody battle,
‘many,’ as Birrel the chronicler reports, ‘being hurte on both
sides by shote of pistoll.’ Three days afterwards there was a
strict proclamation, forbidding ‘the wearing of guns or pistolls,
or aney sick-like fyerwork ingyne, under ye paine of death, the
king’s guards and shouldours only excepted.’ This circumstance
seems to be referred to in <cite>The Abbot</cite>, where the Regent Murray,
in allusion to Lord Seyton’s rencontre with the Leslies, in which
Roland Græme had borne a distinguished part, says: ‘These
broils and feuds would shame the capital of the Great Turk, let
alone that of a Christian and reformed state. But if I live, this
gear shall be amended; and men shall say,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July 1588, according to the same authority,
Sir William Stewart was slain in Blackfriars Wynd by the Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
of Bothwell [the fifth earl], who was the most famed disturber of
the public peace in those times. The quarrel had arisen on a
former occasion, on account of some despiteful language used by
Sir William, when the fiery earl vowed the destruction of his enemy
in words too shocking to be repeated; ‘sua therafter rancountering
Sir William in ye Blackfriar Wynd by chance, told him he
vold now ...; and vith yat drew his sword; Sir William standing
to hes defence, and having hes back at ye vall, ye earle mad
a thrust at him vith his raper, and strake him in at the back and
out at the belley, and killed him.’</p>

<p>Ten years thereafter, one Robert Cathcart, who had been
with the Earl of Bothwell on this occasion, though it does
not appear that he took an active hand in the murder, was
slain in revenge by William Stewart, son of the deceased, while
standing inoffensively at the head of Peebles Wynd, near the
Tron.</p>

<p>In June 1605, one William Thomson, a dagger-maker in the
West Bow, which was even then remarkable for iron-working
handicraftsmen, was slain by John Waterstone, a neighbour of
his own, who was next day beheaded on the Castle-hill for his
crime.</p>

<p>In 1640, the Lawnmarket was the scene of a personal combat
between Major Somerville, commander of the forces then in the
Castle, devoted to the Covenanting interest (a relation of Braid
Hugh in the preceding extract), and one Captain Crawfuird,
which is related in the following picturesque and interesting
manner by the same writer: ‘But it would appear this gentleman
conceived his affront being publict, noe satisfactione acted in a
private way could save his honour; therefore to repair the same,
he resolves to challange and fight Somervill upon the High
Street of Edenburgh, and at such a tyme when ther should be
most spectators. In order to this designe, he takes the occasione,
as this gentleman was betwext ten and eleven hours in the
foirnoon hastily comeing from the Castle (haveing been then
sent for to the Committie of Estates and General Leslie anent
some important busines), to assault him in this manner; Somervill
being past the Weigh-house, Captaine Crawfuird observeing
him, presentlie steps into a high chope upon the south side of
the Landmercat, and there layes by his cloak, haveing a long
broad sword and a large Highland durke by his side; he comes
up to Somervill, and without farder ceremonie sayes: “If you
be a pretty man, draw your sword;” and with that word pulles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
out his oune sword with the dagger. Somervill at first was
somewhat stertled at the impudence and boldnesse of the man
that durst soe openly and avowedly assault him, being in publict
charge, and even then on his duty. But his honour and present
preservatione gave him noe tyme to consult the conveniency or
inconveniency he was now under, either as to his present charge
or disadvantage of weapons, haveing only a great kaine staff<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in
his hand, which for ordinary he walked still with, and that same
sword which Generall Rivane had lately gifted him, being a half-rapper
sword backed, hinging in a shoulder-belt far back, as the
fashion was then, he was forced to guaird two or three strokes
with his kaine before he got out his sword, which being now
drawne, he soon puts his adversary to the defencive part, by
bearing up soe close to him, and putting home his thrusts,
that the captaine, for all his courage and advantage of weapons,
was forced to give back, having now much adoe to parie the
redoubled thrusts that Somervill let in at him, being now
agoeing.</p>

<p>‘The combat (for soe in effect it was, albeit accidental) begane
about the midle of the Landmercat. Somervill drives doune the
captaine, still fighting, neer to the goldsmiths’ chops, where,
fearing to be nailled to the boords (these chops being then all
of timber), he resolved by ane notable blow to revenge all his
former affronts; makeing thairfor a fent, as if he had designed
at Somervill’s right side, haveing parried his thrust with his
dagger, he suddenly turnes his hand, and by a back-blow with
his broadsword he thought to have hamshekelled<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> him in one,
if not both of his legges, which Somervill only prevented by
nimbly leaping backward at the tyme, interposeing the great
kaine that was in his left hand, which was quyte cut through
with the violence of the blow. And now Providence soe
ordered it, that the captaine missing his mark, overstrake himself
soe far, that in tyme he could not recover his sword to a fit
posture of defence, untill Somervill, haveing beaten up the dagger
that was in the captaine’s left hand with the remaineing part of
his oune stick, he instantly closes with him, and with the pummil
of his sword he instantly strikes him doune to the ground, where
at first, because of his baseness, he was mynded to have nailled
him to the ground, but that his heart relented, haveing him in
his mercy. And att that same instant ther happened several of
his oune soulders to come in, who wer soe incensed, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
wer ready to have cut the poor captaine all in pieces, if he had
not rescued him out of theire hands, and saw him safely convoyed
to prisone, where he was layd in the irones, and continued
in prisone in a most miserable and wretched condition somewhat
more than a year.’<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<h3>THE TINKLARIAN DOCTOR.</h3>

<p>In the early part of the last century, the Bowhead was distinguished
as the residence of an odd, half-crazy varlet of a tinsmith
named William Mitchell, who occasionally held forth as a preacher,
and every now and then astounded the quiet people of Edinburgh
with some pamphlet full of satirical personalities. He seems to
have been altogether a strange mixture of fanaticism, humour, and
low cunning. In one of his publications&mdash;a single broadside,
dated 1713&mdash;he has a squib upon the magistrates, in the form of
a <em>leit</em>, or list, of a new set, whom he proposes to introduce in their
stead. At the end he sets forward a claim on his own behalf, no
less than that of representing the city in parliament. In another
of his prose pieces he gives a curious account of a journey which he
made into France, where, he affirms, ‘the king’s court is six times
bigger than the king of Britain’s; his guards have all feathers in
their hats, and their horse-tails are to their heels; and their king
[Louis XV.] is one of the best-favoured boys that you can look
upon&mdash;blithe-like, with black hair; and all his people are better
natured in general than the Scots or English, except the priests.
Their women seem to be modest, for they have no fardingales.
The greatest wonder I saw in France, was to see the braw people
fall down on their knees on the clarty ground when the priest
comes by, carrying the cross, to give a sick person the sacrament.’</p>

<p>The Tinklarian Doctor, for such was his popular appellation,
appears to have been fully acquainted with an ingenious expedient,
long afterwards held in view by publishers of juvenile toy-books.
As in certain sage little histories of Tommy and Harry, King
Pepin, &amp;c., we are sure to find that ‘the good boy who loved his
lessons’ always bought his books from ‘kind, good, old Mr J.
Newberry, at the corner of St Paul’s Churchyard, where the
greatest assortment of nice books for good boys and girls is always
to be had’&mdash;so in the works of Mr Mitchell we find some sly
encomium upon the Tinklarian Doctor constantly peeping forth;
and in the pamphlet from which the above extract is made, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
not forgetful to impress his professional excellence as a whitesmith.
‘I have,’ he says, ‘a good pennyworth of pewter spoons, fine, like
silver&mdash;none such made in Edinburgh&mdash;and silken pocks for wigs,
and French white pearl-beads; all to be sold for little or nothing.’
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> ‘A part of the works of that Eminent Divine and Historian,
Dr William Mitchell, Professor of Tinklarianism in the University
of the <span class="smcap">Bowhead</span>; being a Syze of Divinity, Humanity, History,
Philosophy, Law, and Physick; Composed at Various Occasions
for his own Satisfaction and the World’s Illumination.’ In his
works&mdash;all of which were adorned with a cut of the Mitchell arms&mdash;he
does not scruple to make the personages whom he introduces
speak of himself as a much wiser man than the Archbishop of
Canterbury, all the clergymen of his native country, and even the
magistrates of Edinburgh! One of his last productions was a
pamphlet on the murder of Captain Porteous, which he concludes
by saying, in the true spirit of a Cameronian martyr: ‘If the
king and clergy gar hang me for writing this, I’m content, because
it is long since any man was hanged for religion.’ The learned
Tinklarian was destined, however, to die in his bed&mdash;an event
which came to pass in the year 1740.</p>

<p>The profession of which the Tinklarian Doctor subscribed
himself a member has long been predominant in the West Bow.
We see from a preceding extract that it reckoned dagger-makers
among its worthy denizens in the reign of James VI. But this
trade has long been happily extinct everywhere in Scotland;
though their less formidable brethren the whitesmiths, coppersmiths,
and pewterers have continued down to our own day to
keep almost unrivalled possession of the Bow. Till within these
few years, there was scarcely a shop in this street occupied by
other tradesmen; and it might be supposed that the noise of so
many hammermen, pent up in a narrow thoroughfare, would be
extremely annoying to the neighbourhood. Yet however disagreeable
their clattering might seem to strangers, it is generally
admitted that the people who lived in the West Bow became
habituated to the noise, and felt no inconvenience whatever from
its ceaseless operation upon their ears. Nay, they rather experienced
inconvenience from its cessation, and only felt annoyed when
any period of rest arrived and stopped it. Sunday morning,
instead of favouring repose, made them restless; and when they
removed to another part of the town, beyond the reach of the
sound, sleep was unattainable in the morning for some weeks, till
they got accustomed to the quiescence of their new neighbourhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
An old gentleman once told me that, having occasion in his youth
to lodge for a short time in the West Bow, he found the incessant
clanking extremely disagreeable, and at last entered into a paction
with some of the workmen in his immediate neighbourhood, who
promised to let him have another hour of quiet sleep in the
mornings for the consideration of some such matter as half-a-crown
to drink on Saturday night. The next day happening
(out of his knowledge) to be some species of Saint Monday, his
annoyers did not work at all; but such was the force of a habit
acquired even in a week or little more, that our friend awoke
precisely at the moment when the hammers used to commence;
and he was glad to get his bargain cancelled as soon as possible,
for fear of another morning’s want of disturbance.</p>


<h3>OLD ASSEMBLY-ROOM.</h3>

<p>At the first angle of the Bow, on the west side of the street, is
a tall picturesque-looking house, which tradition points to as
having been the first place where the fashionables of Edinburgh
held their dancing assemblies. Over the door is a well-cut
sculpture of the arms of the Somerville family, together with the
initials P. J. and J. W., and the date 1602. These are memorials
of the original owner of the mansion, a certain Peter Somerville,
a wealthy citizen, at one time filling a dignified situation in the
magistracy, and father of Bartholomew Somerville, who was a
noted benefactor to the then infant university of Edinburgh. The
architrave also bears a legend (the title of the eleventh psalm):</p>

<p class="center">
IN DOMINO CONFIDO.
</p>

<p>Ascending by the narrow spiral stair, we come to the second
floor, now occupied by a dealer in wool, but presenting such
appearances as leave no doubt that it once consisted of a single
lofty wainscoted room, with a carved oak ceiling. Here, then,
did the fair ladies whom Allan Ramsay and William Hamilton
celebrate meet for the recreation of dancing with their toupeed
and deep-skirted beaux. There in that little side-room, formed
by an <em>outshot</em> from the building, did the merry sons of Euterpe
retire to <em>rosin their bows</em> during the intervals of the performance.
Alas! dark are the walls which once glowed with festive light;
burdened is that floor, not with twinkling feet, but with the most
sluggish of inanimate substances. And as for the fiddlers-room&mdash;enough:</p>

<img src="images/illus_p_044.jpg" width="400" height="490" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Assembly-Room.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dancing, although said to be a favourite
amusement and exercise of the Scottish people,
has always been discountenanced, more or less,
in the superior circles
of society, or only
indulged after a very
abstemious and rigid
fashion, until a comparatively
late age.
Everything that
could be called public
or promiscuous
amusement was held
in abhorrence by the
Presbyterians, and
only struggled
through a desultory
and degraded existence
by the favour
of the Jacobites, who
have always been a
less strait-laced part
of the community.
Thus there was nothing
like a conventional
system of
dancing in Edinburgh
till the year
1710, when at length a private association was commenced
under the name of ‘the Assembly;’ and probably its first quarters
were in this humble domicile. The persecution which it experienced
from rigid thinkers and the uninstructed populace of
that age would appear to have been very great. On one occasion,
we are told, the company were assaulted by an infuriated rabble,
and the door of their hall perforated with red-hot spits.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Allan
Ramsay, who was the friend of all amusements, which he conceived
to tend only to cheer this sublunary scene of care, thus
alludes to the Assembly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Sic as against the Assembly speak,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The rudest sauls betray,</div>
<div class="verse">When matrons noble, wise, and meek,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Conduct the healthfu’ play;</div>
<div class="verse">Where they appear nae vice daur keek,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">In bounty to the poor:</div>
<div class="verse">Sic virtues, if right understood,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Should every heart allure.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We can easily see from this, and other symptoms, that the
Assembly had to make many sacrifices to the spirit which sought
to abolish it. In reality, the dancing was conducted under such
severe rules as to render the whole affair more like a night at
La Trappe than anything else. So lately as 1753, when the
Assembly had fallen under the control of a set of directors, and
was much more of a public affair than formerly, we find Goldsmith
giving the following graphic account of its meetings in a
letter to a friend in his own country. The author of the <cite>Deserted
Village</cite> was now studying the medical profession, it must be
recollected, at the university of Edinburgh:</p>

<p>‘Let me say something of their balls, which are very frequent
here. When a stranger enters the dancing-hall, he sees one end
of the room taken up with the ladies, who sit dismally in a group
by themselves; on the other end stand their pensive partners that
are to be; but no more intercourse between the sexes than between
two countries at war. The ladies, indeed, may ogle, and the
gentlemen sigh, but an embargo is laid upon any closer commerce.
At length, to interrupt hostilities, the lady-directress, intendant,
or what you will, pitches on a gentleman and a lady to walk a
minuet, which they perform with a formality approaching to
despondence. After five or six couple have thus walked the
gauntlet, all stand up to country-dances, each gentleman furnished
with a partner from the aforesaid lady-directress. So they dance
much, and say nothing, and thus concludes our Assembly. I told
a Scotch gentleman that such a profound silence resembled the
ancient procession of the Roman matrons in honour of Ceres; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the Scotch gentleman told me (and, faith, I believe he was right)
that I was a very great pedant for my pains.’</p>

<p>In the same letter, however, Goldsmith allows the beauty of
the women and the good-breeding of the men.</p>

<p>It may add to the curiosity of the whole affair, that when the
Assembly was reconstituted in February 1746, after several years
of cessation, the first of a set of regulations hung up in the hall<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
was: ‘<em>No lady to be admitted in a night-gown, and no gentleman
in boots</em>.’ The eighth rule was: ‘No misses in skirts and jackets,
robe-coats, nor stay-bodied gowns, to be allowed to dance in
country-dances, but in a sett by themselves.’</p>

<p>In all probability it was in this very dingy house that Goldsmith
beheld the scene he has so well described. At least it
appears that the improved Assembly Room in Bell’s Wynd (which
has latterly served as a part of the accommodations of the Commercial
Bank) was not built till 1766.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Arnot, in his <cite>History of
Edinburgh</cite>, describes the Assembly Room in Bell’s Wynd as very
inconvenient, which was the occasion of the present one being
built in George Street in 1784.</p>


<h3>PAUL ROMIEU.</h3>

<p>At this angle of the Bow the original city-wall crossed the
line of the street, and there was, accordingly, a gate at this spot,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
of which the only existing memorial is one of the hooks for the
suspension of the hinges, fixed in the front wall of a house, at
the height of about five feet from the ground. It is from the
arch forming this gateway that the street takes its name, <em>bow</em>
being an old word for an arch. The house immediately <em>without</em>
this ancient port, on the east side of the street, was occupied,
about the beginning of the last century, and perhaps at an earlier
period, by Paul Romieu, an eminent watchmaker, supposed to
have been one of the French refugees driven over to this country
in consequence of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
is the more likely, as he seems, from the workmanship of his
watches, to have been a contemporary of Tompion, the famous
London horologist of the reign of Charles II. In the front of
the house, upon the third story, there is still to be seen the
remains of a curious piece of mechanism&mdash;namely, a gilt ball
representing the moon, which was made to revolve by means of
a clock.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>


<h3>‘HE THAT THOLES OVERCOMES.’</h3>

<p>Pursuing our way down the steep and devious street, we pass
an antique wooden-faced house, bearing the odd name of the
<em>Mahogany Land</em>, and just before turning the
second corner, pause before a stone one of
equally antiquated structure,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> having a
wooden-screened outer stair. Over the door
at the head of this stair is a legend in
very old lettering&mdash;certainly not later than
1530&mdash;and hardly to be deciphered. With
difficulty we make it out to be:</p>

<p class="center">
HE YT THOLIS OVERCVMMIS.
</p>

<p><em>He that tholes</em> (that is, bears) <em>overcomes</em>;
equivalent to what Virgil says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Quidquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est.’</div>
</div>

<p class="right">
<cite>Æneid</cite>, v.
</p></div></div>

<p>We may safely speculate on this inscription
being antecedent in date to the Reformation,
as after that period merely moral
apothegms were held in little regard, and
none but biblical inscriptions were actually
put upon the fronts of houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/illus_p_047.jpg" width="250" height="421" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Mahogany Land, West Bow.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the other side of the street is a small shop (marked No. 69),
now occupied by a dealer in small miscellaneous wares,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and which
was, a hundred years ago, open for a nearly similar kind of
business, under the charge of a Mrs Jeffrey. When, on the night
of the 7th September 1736, the rioters hurried their victim
Porteous down the West Bow, with the design of executing him
in the Grassmarket, they called at this shop to provide themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
with a rope. The woman asked if it was to hang Porteous, and
when they answered in the affirmative, she told them they were
welcome to all she had of that article. They coolly took off what
they required, and laid a guinea on the counter as payment;
ostentatious to mark that they ‘did all in honour.’</p>


<h3>PROVOST STEWART’S HOUSE&mdash;DONALDSONS
THE BOOKSELLERS.</h3>

<p>The upper floors of the house which looks down into the
Grassmarket formed the mansion of Mr Archibald Stewart, Lord
Provost of Edinburgh in 1745. This is an abode of singular
structure and arrangements, having its principal access by a close
out of another street, and only a postern one into the Bow, and
being full of curious little wainscoted rooms, concealed closets,
and secret stairs. In one apartment there is a cabinet, or what
appears a cabinet, about three feet high: this, when cross-examined,
turns out to be the mask of a trap-stair. Only a
smuggler, one would think, or a gentleman conducting treasonable
negotiations, could have bethought him of building such a house.
Whether Provost Stewart, who was a thorough Jacobite, was the
designer of these contrivances, I cannot tell; but fireside gossip
used to have a strange story as to his putting his trap-stair to use
on one important occasion. It was said that, during the occupation
of Edinburgh by the Highland army in ’45, his lordship was
honoured one evening with a secret visit from the Prince and some
of his principal officers. The situation was critical, for close by
was the line between the Highland guards and the beleaguered
environs of the Castle. Intelligence of the Prince’s movements
being obtained by the governor of the fortress, a party was sent
to seize him in the provost’s house. They made their approach
by the usual access from the Castle-hill Street; but an alarm
preceded them, and before they obtained admission, the provost’s
visitors had vanished through the mysterious cabinet, and made
their exit by the back-door. What real foundation there may
have been for this somewhat wild-looking story I do not pretend
to say.</p>

<p>The house was at a subsequent time the residence of Alexander
Donaldson the bookseller, whose practice of reprinting modern
English books in Edinburgh, and his consequent litigation with
the London booksellers, attracted much attention sixty years since.
Printing and publishing were in a low state in Edinburgh before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
the time of Donaldson. In the frank language of Hugo Arnot:
‘The printing of newspapers and of school-books, of the fanatick
effusions of Presbyterian clergymen, and the law papers of the
Court of Session, joined to the patent Bible printing, gave a
scanty employment to four printing-offices.’ About the middle
of the century, the English law of copyright not extending to
Scotland, some of the booksellers began to reprint the productions
of the English authors of the day; for example, the <cite>Rambler</cite>
was regularly reproduced in this manner in Edinburgh, with no
change but the addition of English translations of the Latin
mottoes, which were supplied by Mr James Elphinstone. From
this and minor causes, it came to pass that, in 1779, there were
twenty-seven printing-offices in Edinburgh. The most active man
in this trade was Alexander Donaldson, who likewise reprinted
in Edinburgh, and sold in London, English books of which the
author’s fourteen years’ copyright had expired, and which were
then only protected by a usage of the London trade, rendering
it dishonourable as between man and man, among themselves, to
reprint a book which had hitherto been the assigned property of
one of their number. Disregarding the rule of his fraternity,
Donaldson set up a shop in the Strand for the sale of his cheap
Edinburgh editions of the books of expired copyright. They met
an immense sale, and proved of obvious service to the public,
especially to those of limited means; though, as Johnson remarked,
this made Donaldson ‘no better than Robin Hood, who robbed
the rich in order to give to the poor.’ In reality, the London
booksellers had no right beyond one of class sentiment, and this
was fully found when they wrestled with Mr Donaldson at law.
Waiving all question on this point, Donaldson may be considered
as a sort of morning-star of that reformation which has resulted in
the universal cheapening of literary publications. Major Topham,
in 1775, speaks of a complete set of the English classics which
he was bringing out, ‘in a very handsome binding,’ at the rate of
one and sixpence a volume!</p>

<p>[Donaldson, in 1763, started a twice-a-week newspaper under
the name of the <cite>Edinburgh Advertiser</cite>, which was for a long
course of years the prominent journal on the Conservative side,
and eminently lucrative, chiefly through its multitude of advertisements.
All his speculations being of a prosperous nature, he
acquired considerable wealth, which he left to his son, the late
Mr James Donaldson, by whom the newspaper was conducted for
many years. James added largely to his wealth by successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
speculations in the funds, where he held so large a sum that the
rise of a per cent. made him a thousand pounds richer than he
had been the day before. Prompted by the example of Heriot
and Watson, and partly, perhaps, by that modification of egotism
which makes us love to be kept in the remembrance of future
generations, James Donaldson, at his death in 1830, devoted the
mass of his fortune&mdash;about £240,000&mdash;for the foundation of a
<em>hospital</em> for the maintenance and education of poor children of
both sexes; and a structure for the purpose was erected, on a
magnificent plan furnished by Mr Playfair, at an expense, it is
said, of about £120,000.</p>

<p>The old house in the West Bow&mdash;which was possessed by both
of these remarkable men in succession, and the scene of their
entertainments to the literary men of the last age, with some of
whom Alexander Donaldson lived on terms of intimacy&mdash;stood
unoccupied for several years before 1824, when it was burnt down.
New buildings now occupy its site.]</p>


<h3>TEMPLARS’ LANDS.</h3>

<p>We have now arrived at the <em>Bow-foot</em>, about which there is
nothing remarkable to be told, except that here, and along one
side of the Grassmarket, are several houses marked by a cross
on some conspicuous part&mdash;either an actual iron cross, or one
represented in sculpture. This seems a strange circumstance in
a country where it was even held doubtful, twenty years ago,
whether one could be placed as an ornament on the top of a
church tower. The explanation is that these houses were built
upon lands originally the property of the Knights Templars, and
the cross has ever since been kept up upon them, not from any
veneration for that ancient society, neither upon any kind of
religious ground; the sole object has been to fix in remembrance
certain legal titles and privileges which have been transmitted
into secular hands from that source, and which are to this day
productive of solid benefits. A hundred years ago, the houses
thus marked were held as part of the barony of Drem in
Haddingtonshire, the baron of which used to hold courts in them
occasionally; and here were harboured many persons not free of
the city corporations, to the great annoyance of the adherents
of local monopoly. At length, the abolition of heritable jurisdictions
in 1747 extinguished this little barony, but not certain
other legal rights connected with the <em>Templar Lands</em>, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
it might be more troublesome to explain than advantageous
to know.</p>

<h3>THE GALLOWS STONE.</h3>

<p>In a central situation at the east end of the Grassmarket,
there remained till very lately a massive block of sandstone,
having a quadrangular hole in the middle, being the stone which
served as a socket for the gallows, when this was the common
place of execution. Instead of the stone, there is now only a
St Andrew’s cross, indicated by an arrangement of the paving-stones.</p>

<p>This became the regular scene of executions after the Restoration,
and so continued till the year 1784. Hence arises the sense
of the Duke of Rothes’s remark when a Covenanting prisoner
proved obdurate: ‘Then e’en let him glorify God in the Grassmarket!’&mdash;the
deaths of that class of victims being always
signalised by psalm-singing on the scaffold. Most of the hundred
persons who suffered for that cause in Edinburgh during the reigns
of Charles II. and James II. breathed their last pious aspirations
at this spot; but several of the most notable, including the Marquis
and Earl of Argyll, were executed at the Cross.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, this was the scene of the Porteous riot
in 1736, and of the subsequent murder of Porteous by the mob.
The rioters, wishing to despatch him as near to the place of his
alleged crime as possible, selected for the purpose a dyer’s pole
which stood on the south side of the street, exactly opposite to
the gallows stone.</p>

<p>Some of the Edinburgh executioners have been so far notable
men as to be the subject of traditionary fame. In the reign of
Charles II., Alexander Cockburn, the hangman of Edinburgh, and
who must have officiated at the exits of many of the ‘martyrs’ in
the Grassmarket, was found guilty of the murder of a bluegown,
or privileged beggar, and accordingly suffered that fate which he
had so often meted out to other men. One Mackenzie, the hangman
of Stirling, whom Cockburn had traduced and endeavoured
to thrust out of office, was the triumphant executioner of the
sentence.</p>

<p>Another Edinburgh hangman of this period was a reduced
gentleman, the last of a respectable family who had possessed
an estate in the neighbourhood of Melrose. He had been a
profligate in early life, squandered the whole of his patrimony,
and at length, for the sake of subsistence, was compelled to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
this wretched office, which in those days must have been unusually
obnoxious to popular odium, on account of the frequent executions
of innocent and religious men. Notwithstanding his extreme
degradation, this unhappy reprobate could not altogether forget
his original station and his former tastes and habits. He would
occasionally resume the garb of a gentleman, and mingle in the
parties of citizens who played at golf in the evenings on Bruntsfield
Links. Being at length recognised, he was chased from the ground
with shouts of execration and loathing, which affected him so
much that he retired to the solitude of the King’s Park, and was
next day found dead at the bottom of a precipice, over which he
was supposed to have thrown himself in despair. This rock was
afterwards called the <em>Hangman’s Craig</em>.</p>

<p>In the year 1700, when the Scottish people were in a state of
great excitement on account of the interference of the English
government against their expedition to Darien, some persons were
apprehended for a riot in the city of Edinburgh, and sentenced to
be whipped and put upon the pillory. As these persons had acted
under the influence of the general feeling, they excited the sympathy
of the people in an extraordinary degree, and even the
hangman was found to have scruples about the propriety of
punishing them. Upon the pillory they were presented with
flowers and wine; and when arrayed for flagellation, the executioner
made a mere mockery of his duty, never once permitting
his whip to touch their backs. The magistrates were very indignant
at the conduct of their servant, and sentenced him to be
scourged in his turn. However, when the Haddington executioner
was brought to officiate upon his metropolitan brother, he was so
much frightened by the threatening aspect of the mob that he
thought it prudent to make his escape through a neighbouring
alley. The laugh was thus turned against the magistrates, who,
it was said, would require to get a third executioner to punish the
Haddington man. They prudently dropped the whole matter.</p>

<p>At a somewhat later period, the Edinburgh official was a man
named John Dalgleish. He it was who acted at the execution
of Wilson the smuggler in 1736, and who is alluded to so
frequently in the tale of the <cite>Heart of Mid-Lothian</cite>. Dalgleish,
I have heard, was esteemed, before his taking up this office, as a
person in creditable circumstances. He is memorable for one
pithy saying. Some one asking him how he contrived in whipping
a criminal to adjust the weight of his arm, on which, it is obvious,
much must depend: ‘Oh,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span> ‘I lay on the lash according to
my conscience.’ Either Jock, or some later official, was remarked
to be a regular <em>hearer</em> at the Tolbooth Church. As no other
person would sit in the same seat, he always had a pew to himself.
He regularly communicated; but here the exclusiveness of his
fellow-creatures also marked itself, and the clergyman was obliged
to serve a separate table for the hangman, after the rest of the
congregation had retired from the church.</p>

<p>The last Edinburgh executioner of whom any particular notice
has been taken by the public was John High, commonly called
Jock Heich, who acceded to the office in the year 1784, and died
so lately as 1817. High had been originally induced to undertake
this degrading duty in order to escape the punishment due
to a petty offence&mdash;that of stealing poultry. I remember him
living in his official mansion in a lane adjoining to the Cowgate&mdash;a
small wretched-looking house, assigned by the magistrates
for the residence of this race of officers, and which has only been
removed within the last few years, to make way for the extension
of the buildings of the Parliament Square. He had then a second
wife, whom he used to beat unmercifully. Since Jock’s days, no
executioner has been so conspicuous as to be known by name.
The fame of the occupation seems somehow to have departed.</p>


<p class="p2">I have now finished my account of the West Bow; a most
antiquated place, yet not without its virtues even as to matters
of the present day. Humble as the street appears, many of
its shopkeepers and other inhabitants are of a very respectable
character. Bankruptcies are said to be very rare in the Bow.
Most of the traders are of old standing, and well-to-do in the
world; few but what are the proprietors of their own shops and
dwellings, which, in such a community, indicates something like
wealth. The smarter and more dashing men of Princes Street
and the Bridges may smile at their homely externals and darksome
little places of business, or may not even pay them the
compliment of thinking of them at all; yet, while they boast not
of their ‘warerooms,’ or their troops of ‘young men,’ or their
plate-glass windows, they at least feel no apprehension from the
approach of rent-day, and rarely experience tremulations on the
subject of bills. Perhaps, if strict investigation were made, the
‘bodies’ of the Bow could show more comfortable balances at
the New Year than at least a half of the sublime men who pay
an income by way of rental in George Street. Not one of them
but is respectfully known by a good sum on the creditor side at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Sir William Forbes’s; not one but can stand at his shop-door,

<p>James’s Court, a well-known pile of building of great altitude
at the head of the Earthen Mound, was erected about
1725-27 by James Brownhill,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> a joiner, as a speculation, and was
for some years regarded as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quartier</i> of greatest dignity and
importance in Edinburgh. The inhabitants, who were all persons
of consequence in society, although each had but a single
floor of four or five rooms and a kitchen, kept a clerk to
record their names and proceedings,
had a scavenger of their own,
clubbed in many public measures,
and had balls and parties among
themselves exclusively. In those

<h3>DAVID HUME.</h3>

<p>The first fixed residence of
David Hume in Edinburgh appears
to have been in <em>Riddel’s
Land</em>, Lawnmarket, near the head
of the West Bow. He commenced
housekeeping there in 1751, when,
according to his own account, he ‘removed from the country to
the town, the true scene for a man of letters.’ It was while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
Riddel’s Land that he published his <cite>Political Discourses</cite>, and
obtained the situation of librarian to the Faculty of Advocates.
In this place also he commenced the writing of his <cite>History of
England</cite>. He dates from Riddel’s Land in January 1753, but in
June we find him removed to
<em>Jack’s Land</em>,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a somewhat airier
situation in the Canongate,
where he remained for nine
years. Excepting only the small
portion composed in the Lawnmarket
mansion, the whole of
the <cite>History of England</cite> was
written in Jack’s Land; a fact
which will probably raise some
interest respecting that locality.
It is, in reality, a plain, middle-aged
fabric, of no particular appearance,
and without a single
circumstance of a curious
nature connected with it,
besides the somewhat odd
one that the continuator of
the <cite>History</cite>, Smollett, lived,
some time after, in his
sister’s house precisely opposite.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jack’s Land, Canongate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hume removed at Whitsunday
1762 to a house
which he purchased in
James’s Court&mdash;the eastern
portion of the third floor
in the west stair (counting from the level of the court). This was
such a step as a man would take in those days as a consequence of
improvement in his circumstances. The philosopher had lived
in James’s Court but a short time, when he was taken to France
as secretary to the embassy. In his absence, which lasted several
years, his house was occupied by Dr Blair, who here had a son of
the Duke of Northumberland as a pupil. It is interesting to find
Hume, some time after, writing to his friend Dr Ferguson from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
the midst of the gaieties of Paris: ‘I am sensible that I am
misplaced, and I wish twice or thrice a day for <em>my easy-chair and
my retreat in James’s Court</em>.’ Then he adds a beautiful sentiment:
‘Never think, dear Ferguson, that as long as you are master of
your own fireside and your own time, you can be unhappy, or that
any other circumstance can add to your enjoyment.’<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In one of
his letters to Blair he speaks minutely of his house: ‘Never put
a fire in the south room with the red paper. It was so warm of
itself that all last winter, which was a very severe one, I lay with
a single blanket; and frequently, upon coming in at midnight
starving with cold, have sat down and read for an hour, as if I had
had a stove in the room.’ From 1763 till 1766 he lived in high
diplomatic situations at Paris; and thinking to settle there for life,
for the sake of the agreeable society, gave orders to sell his house
in Edinburgh. He informs us, in a letter to the Countess de
Boufflers (<cite>General Correspondence</cite>, 4to, 1820, p. 231), that he was
prevented by a singular accident from carrying his intention into
effect. After writing a letter to Edinburgh for the purpose of
disposing of his house, and leaving it with his Parisian landlord,
he set out to pass his Christmas with the Countess de Boufflers
at L’Isle Adam; but being driven back by a snowstorm, which
blocked up the roads, he found on his return that the letter had
not been sent to the post-house. More deliberate thoughts then
determined him to keep up his Edinburgh mansion, thinking that,
if any affairs should call him to his native country, ‘it would be
very inconvenient not to have a house to retire to.’ On his
return, therefore, in 1766, he re-entered into possession of his <em>flat</em>
in James’s Court, but was soon again called from it by an invitation
from Mr Conway to be an under-secretary of state. At length, in
1769, he returned permanently to his native city, in possession of
what he thought opulence&mdash;a thousand a year. We find him
immediately writing from his retreat in James’s Court to his friend
Adam Smith, then commencing his great work <cite>On the Wealth of
Nations</cite> in the quiet of his mother’s house at Kirkcaldy: ‘I am
glad to have come within sight of you, and to have a view of
Kirkcaldy from my windows; but I wish also to be within speaking-terms
of you,’ &amp;c. To another person he writes: ‘I live still, and
must for a twelvemonth, in my old house in James’s Court, which
is very cheerful, and even elegant, but too small to display my
great talent for cookery, the science to which I intend to addict
the remaining years of my life!’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span></p>
<p>Hume now built a superior house for himself in the New Town,
which was then little beyond its commencement, selecting a site
adjoining to St Andrew Square. The superintendence of this
work was an amusement to him. A story is related in more than
one way regarding the manner in which a denomination was
conferred upon the street in which this house is situated. Perhaps,
if it be premised that a corresponding street at the other angle of
St Andrew Square is called <em>St Andrew Street</em>&mdash;a natural enough
circumstance with reference to the square, whose title was determined
on in the plan&mdash;it will appear likely that the choosing of
‘St David Street’ for that in which Hume’s house stood was not
originally designed as a jest at his expense, though a second
thought, and the whim of his friends, might quickly give it that
application. The story, as told by Mr Burton, is as follows:
‘When the house was built and inhabited by Hume, but while yet
the street of which it was the commencement had no name, a witty
young lady, daughter of Baron Ord, chalked on the wall the words,
<span class="smcap">St David Street</span>. The allusion was very obvious. Hume’s “lass,”
judging that it was not meant in honour or reverence, ran into the
house much excited, to tell her master how he was made game of.
“Never mind, lassie,” he said, “many a better man has been made
a saint of before.”’</p>

<p>That Hume was a native of Edinburgh is well known. One
could wish to know the spot of his birth; but it is not now
perhaps possible to ascertain it. The nearest approach made to
the fact is from intelligence conveyed by a memorandum in his
father’s handwriting among the family papers, where he speaks of
‘my son David, born in the <em>Tron Church parish</em>’&mdash;a district
comprehending a large square clump of town between the High
Street and Cowgate, east of the site of the church itself.</p>

<p>One of Hume’s most intimate friends amongst the other sex was
Mrs Cockburn, author of one of the beautiful songs called <cite>The
Flowers of the Forest</cite>. While he was in France in 1764, she
writes to him from <em>Baird’s Close,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Castle-hill</em>: ‘The cloven foot for
which thou art worshipped I despise; yet I remember <em>thee</em> with
affection. I remember that, in spite of vain philosophy, of dark
doubts, of toilsome learning, God has stamped his image of
benignity so strong upon thy <em>heart</em>, that not all the labours of thy
head could efface it.’ After Hume’s return to Edinburgh, he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
up his acquaintance with this spirited and amiable woman. The
late Mr Alexander Young, W.S., had some reminiscences of parties
which he attended when a boy at her house, and at which the
philosopher was present. Hume came in one evening behind time
for her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit souper</i>, when, seeing her bustling to get something for
him to eat, he called out: ‘Now, no trouble, if you please, about
quality; for you know I’m only a glutton, not an epicure.’ Mr
Young attended at a dinner where, besides Hume, there were
present Lord Monboddo and some other learned personages. Mrs
Cockburn was then living in the neat first floor of a house at the
end of Crighton Street, with windows looking along the Potterrow.
She had a son of eccentric habits, in middle life, or rather elderly,
who came in during the dinner tipsy, and going into a bedroom,
locked himself in, went to bed, and fell asleep. The company in
time made a move for departure, when it was discovered that their
hats, cloaks, and greatcoats were all locked up in Mr Cockburn’s
room. The door was knocked at and shaken, but no answer.
What was to be done? At length Mrs Cockburn had no alternative
from sending out to her neighbours to borrow a supply of
similar integuments, which was soon procured. There was then
such fun in fitting the various <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> with suitable substitutes for
their own proper gear! Hume, for instance, with a dreadnought
riding-coat; Monboddo with a shabby old hat, as unlike his own
neat chapeau as possible! In the highest exaltation of spirits did
these two men of genius at length proceed homeward along the
Potterrow, Horse Wynd, Assembly Close, &amp;c., making the old
echoes merry with their peals of laughter at the strange appearance
which they respectively made.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>I lately inspected Hume’s <em>cheerful and elegant</em> mansion in James’s
Court, and found it divided amongst three or four tenants in
humble life, each possessing little more than a single room. It
was amusing to observe that what had been the dining-room
and drawing-room towards the north were <em>each</em> provided with one
of those little side oratories which have been described elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
as peculiar to a period in Edinburgh house-building, being designed
for private devotion. Hume living in a house with two private
chapels!</p>


<h3>JAMES BOSWELL.</h3>

<p>It appears that one of the immediately succeeding leaseholders
of Hume’s house in James’s Court was James Boswell. Mr Burton
has made this tolerably clear (<cite>Life of Hume</cite>, ii. 137), and he
proceeds to speculate on the fact of Boswell having there entertained
his friend Johnson. ‘Would Boswell communicate the fact,
or tell what manner of man was the landlord of the habitation
into which he had, under the guise of hospitality, entrapped the
arch-intolerant? Who shall appreciate the mental conflict which
Boswell may have experienced on this occasion?’ It appears,
however, that by the time when Johnson visited Boswell in James’s
Court, the latter had removed into a better and larger mansion
right below and on the level of the court&mdash;namely, that now
(1846) occupied by Messrs Pillans as a printing-office. This was
an extraordinary house in its day; for it consisted of two floors
connected by an internal stair. Here it was that the Ursa Major
of literature stayed for a few days, in August 1773, while preparing
to set out to the Hebrides, and also for some time after his return.
Here did he receive the homage of the trembling literati of
Edinburgh; here, after handling them in his rough manner, did
he relax in play with little Miss Veronica, whom Boswell promised
to consider peculiarly in his will for showing a liking to so
estimable a man. What makes all this evident is a passage in a
letter of Samuel himself to Mrs Thrale (Edinburgh, August 17),
where he says: ‘Boswell has very handsome and spacious rooms,
level with the ground on one side of the house, and on the other
four stories high.’ Boswell was only tenant of the mansion. It
affords a curious idea of the importance which formerly attached
to some of these Old Town residences, when we learn that this was
part of the entailed estate of the Macdowalls of Logan, one of
whom sold it, by permission of an act of parliament, to redeem
the land-tax upon his country property.</p>

<p>Boswell ceased to be a citizen of Edinburgh in 1785, when
he was pleased to venture before the English bar. He is little
remembered amongst the elder inhabitants of our city; but the
late Mr William Macfarlane, the well-known small-debt judge, told
me that there was <em>this</em> peculiarity about him&mdash;it was impossible
to look in his face without being moved by the comicality which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
always reigned upon it. He was one of those men whose very look
is provocative of mirth. Mr Robert Sym, W.S., who died in 1844,
at an advanced age, remembered being at parties in this house in
Boswell’s time.</p>


<h3>LORD FOUNTAINHALL.</h3>

<p>Before James’s Court was built, its site was occupied by certain
closes, in one of which dwelt Lord Fountainhall, so distinguished
as an able, liberal, and upright judge, and still more so by his
industrious habits as a collector of historical memorabilia, and of
the decisions of the Court of Session. Though it is considerably
upwards of a century since Lord Fountainhall died,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> a traditionary
anecdote of his residence in this place has been handed down till
the present time by a surprisingly small number of persons. The
mother of the late Mr Gilbert Innes of Stow was a daughter of his
lordship’s son, Sir Andrew Lauder, and she used to describe to her
children the visits she used to pay to her venerable grandfather’s
house, situated, as she said, where James’s Court now stands. She
and her sister, a little girl like herself, always went with their maid
on the Saturday afternoons, and were shown into the room where
the aged judge was sitting&mdash;a room covered with gilt leather,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and containing many huge presses and cabinets, one of which was
ornamented with a death’s-head at the top. After amusing themselves
for an hour or two with his lordship, they used to get each
a shilling from him, and retire to the anteroom, where, as Mrs
Innes well recollected, the waiting-maid invariably pounced upon
their money, and appropriated it to her own use. It is curious to
think that the mother of a gentlewoman living in 1839 (for only
then did Miss Innes of Stow leave this earthly scene) should have
been familiar with a lawyer who entered at the bar soon after the
Restoration (1668), and acted as counsel for the unfortunate Earl
of Argyll in 1681; a being of an age as different in every respect
from the present as the wilds of North America are different from
the long-practised lands of Lothian or Devonshire.</p>

<p>The judicial designation of Lord Fountainhall was adopted from
a place belonging to him in East Lothian, now the property of his
representative, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. The original name of
the place was Woodhead. When the able lawyer came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
bench, and, as usual, thought of a new appellative of a territorial
kind&mdash;‘Woodhead&mdash;Lord Woodhead,’ thought he; ‘that will
never do for a judge!’ So the name of the place was changed
to Fountainhall, and he became Lord Fountainhall accordingly.</p>

<p>[1868.&mdash;The western half of James’s Court having been destroyed
by accidental fire, the reader will now find a new building on the
spot. The houses rendered interesting by the names of Blair,
Boswell, Johnson, and Hume are consequently no more.]</p>

<div class="figcenter w275">
<img src="images/illus_p_064.jpg" width="275" height="164" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This was the last residence of a lady conspicuous in Scottish
society in the early part of the last century&mdash;the widow of the
celebrated commander and diplomatist, John, Earl of Stair. Lady
Eleanor Campbell was, by paternal descent, nearly related to one
of the greatest historical figures of the preceding century, being the
granddaughter of the Chancellor, Earl of Loudon, whose talents
and influence on the Covenanting side were at one time believed to
have nearly procured him the honour of a secret death at the
command of Charles I. Her ladyship’s first adventure in matrimony
led to a series of circumstances of a marvellous nature, which I
shall set down exactly as they used to be related by friends of the
lady in the last century. It was her lot, at an early age, to be
united to James, Viscount Primrose, a man of the worst temper
and most dissolute manners. Her ladyship, who had no small
share of the old chancellor in her constitution, could have managed
most men with ease, by dint of superior intellect and force of
character; but the cruelty of Lord Primrose was too much for her.
He treated her so barbarously that she had even reason to fear
that he would some day put an end to her life. One morning she
was dressing herself in her chamber, near an open window, when
his lordship entered the room behind her with a drawn sword in
his hand. He had opened the door softly, and although his face
indicated a resolution of the most horrible nature, he still had the
presence of mind to approach her with caution. Had she not
caught a glimpse of his face and figure in the glass, he would in all
probability have come near enough to execute his bloody purpose
before she was aware or could have taken any measures to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
herself. Fortunately, she perceived him in time to leap out of
the open window into the street. Half-dressed as she was, she
immediately, by a very laudable exertion of her natural good sense,
went to the house of Lord Primrose’s mother, where she told her
story, and demanded protection. That protection was at once
extended; and it being now thought vain to attempt a reconciliation,
they never afterwards lived together.</p>

<p>Lord Primrose soon afterwards went abroad. During his
absence, a foreign conjurer, or fortune-teller, came to Edinburgh,
professing, among many other wonderful accomplishments, to be
able to inform any person of the present condition or situation of
any other person, at whatever distance, in whom the applicant
might be interested. Lady Primrose was incited by curiosity to
go with a female friend to the lodgings of the wise man in the
Canongate, for the purpose of inquiring regarding the motions of
her husband, of whom she had not heard for a considerable time.
It was at night; and the two ladies went, with the tartan <em>screens</em>
or <em>plaids</em> of their servants drawn over their faces by way of disguise.
Lady Primrose having described the individual in whose fate she
was interested, and having expressed a desire to know what he was
at present doing, the conjurer led her to a large mirror, in which
she distinctly perceived the appearance of the inside of a church,
with a marriage-party arranged near the altar. To her astonishment,
she recognised in the shadowy bridegroom no other than her
husband. The magical scene was not exactly like a picture; or if
so, it was rather like the live pictures of the stage than the dead
and immovable delineations of the pencil. It admitted of additions
to the persons represented, and of a progress of action. As the
lady gazed on it, the ceremonial of the marriage seemed to proceed.
The necessary arrangements had at last been made, the priest
seemed to have pronounced the preliminary service; he was just
on the point of bidding the bride and bridegroom join hands,
when suddenly a gentleman, for whom the rest seemed to have
waited a considerable time, and in whom Lady Primrose thought
she recognised a brother of her own, then abroad, entered the
church, and advanced hurriedly towards the party. The aspect
of this person was at first only that of a friend who had been
invited to attend the ceremony, and who had come too late;
but as he advanced, the expression of his countenance and
figure was altered. He stopped short; his face assumed a
wrathful expression; he drew his sword, and rushed up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
bridegroom, who prepared to defend himself. The whole scene
then became tumultuous and indistinct, and soon after vanished
entirely away.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>When Lady Primrose reached home she wrote a minute narrative
of the whole transaction, to which she appended the day of the
month on which she had seen the mysterious vision. This narrative
she sealed up in the presence of a witness, and then deposited it in
one of her drawers. Soon afterwards her brother returned from
his travels, and came to visit her. She asked if, in the course of
his wanderings, he had happened to see or hear anything of Lord
Primrose. The young man only answered by saying that he wished
he might never again hear the name of that detested personage
mentioned. Lady Primrose, however, questioned him so closely
that he at last confessed having met his lordship, and that under
very strange circumstances. Having spent some time at one of the
Dutch cities&mdash;it was either Amsterdam or Rotterdam&mdash;he had
become acquainted with a rich merchant, who had a very beautiful
daughter, his only child, and the heiress of his large fortune. One
day his friend the merchant informed him that his daughter was
about to be married to a Scottish gentleman, who had lately come
to reside there. The nuptials were to take place in the course of
a few days; and as he was a countryman of the bridegroom, he
was invited to the wedding. He went accordingly, was a little too
late for the commencement of the ceremony, but fortunately came
in time to prevent the sacrifice of an amiable young lady to the
greatest monster alive in human shape&mdash;his own brother-in-law,
Lord Primrose!</p>

<p>The story proceeds to say that although Lady Primrose had
proved her willingness to believe in the magical delineations of the
mirror by writing down an account of them, yet she was so much
surprised by discovering them to be the representation of actual
fact that she almost fainted. Something, however, yet remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
to be ascertained. Did Lord Primrose’s attempted marriage take
place exactly at the same time with her visit to the conjurer? She
asked her brother on what day the circumstance which he related
took place. Having been informed, she took out her key, and
requested him to go to her chamber, to open a drawer which she
described, and to bring her a sealed packet which he would find in
that drawer. On the packet being opened, it was discovered that
Lady Primrose had seen the shadowy representation of her husband’s
abortive nuptials on the very evening when they were transacted
in reality.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Lord Primrose died in 1706, leaving a widow who could scarcely
be expected to mourn for him. She was still a young and beautiful
woman, and might have procured her choice among twenty better
matches. Such, however, was the idea she had formed of the
marriage state from her first husband that she made a resolution
never again to become a wife. She kept her resolution for many
years, and probably would have done so till the last but for a
singular circumstance. The celebrated Earl of Stair, who resided
in Edinburgh during the greater part of twenty years, which he
spent in retirement from all official employments, became deeply
smitten with her ladyship, and earnestly sued for her hand. If
she could have relented in favour of any man, it would have
been for one who had acquired so much public honour, and whose
private character was also, in general respects, so estimable. But
to him also she declared her resolution of remaining unmarried.
In his desperation, he resolved upon an expedient which strongly
marks the character of the age in respect of delicacy. By dint of
bribes to her domestics, he got himself insinuated overnight into a
small room in her ladyship’s house, where she used to say her
prayers every morning, and the window of which looked out upon
the principal street of the city. At this window, when the morning
was a little advanced, he showed himself, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en déshabillé</i>, to the people
passing along the street; an exhibition which threatened to have
such an effect upon her ladyship’s reputation that she saw fit to
accept of him for a husband.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span></p>
<p>She was more happy as Countess of Stair than she had been as
Lady Primrose. Yet her new husband had one failing, which
occasioned her no small uneasiness. Like most other gentlemen
at that period, he sometimes indulged too much in the bottle.
When elevated with liquor, his temper, contrary to the general
case, was by no means improved. Thus, on reaching home after a
debauch, he generally had a quarrel with his wife, and sometimes
even treated her with violence. On one occasion, when quite
transported beyond the bounds of reason, he gave her so severe a
blow upon the upper part of the face as to occasion the effusion of
blood. He immediately after fell asleep, unconscious of what he
had done. Lady Stair was so overwhelmed by a tumult of bitter
and poignant feeling that she made no attempt to bind up her
wound. She sat down on a sofa near her torpid husband, and
wept and bled till morning. When his lordship awoke, and perceived
her dishevelled and bloody figure, he was surprised to the
last degree, and eagerly inquired how she came to be in such an
unusual condition. She answered by detailing to him the whole
history of his conduct on the preceding evening; which stung
him so deeply with regret&mdash;for he naturally possessed the most
generous feelings&mdash;that he instantly vowed to his wife never afterwards
to take any species of drink except what was first passed
through her hands. This vow he kept most scrupulously till the
day of his death. He never afterwards sat in any convivial
company where his lady could not attend to sanction his potations.
Whenever he gave any entertainment, she always sat next him and
filled his wine, till it was necessary for her to retire; after which,
he drank only from a certain quantity which she had first laid
aside.</p>

<p>With much that was respectable in her character, we must
not be too much surprised that Lady Stair was capable of using
terms of speech which a subsequent age has learned to look on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
as objectionable, even in the humblest class of society. The
Earl of Dundonald, it appears, had stated to the Duke of
Douglas that Lady Stair had expressed incredulity regarding the
genuineness of the birth of his nephews, the children of Lady
Jane Douglas, and did not consider Lady Jane as entitled to
any allowance from the duke on their account. In support of
what he reported, Dundonald, in a letter to the Lord Justice-Clerk,
gave the world leave to think him ‘a damned villain’ if
he did not speak the truth. This seems to have involved Lady
Stair unpleasantly with her friends of the house of Douglas, and
she lost little time in making her way to Holyroodhouse, where,
before the duke and duchess and their attendants, she declared
that she had lived to a good old age, and never till now had got
entangled in any <em>clatters</em>&mdash;that is, scandal. The old dame then
thrice stamped the floor with her staff, each time calling the
Earl of Dundonald ‘a damned villain;’ after which she retired
in great wrath. Perhaps this scene was characteristic, for we
learn from letters of Lady M. W. Montagu that Lady Stair
was subject to hysterical ailments, and would be screaming and
fainting in one room, while her daughter, Miss Primrose, and
Lady Mary were dancing in another.</p>

<p>This venerable lady, after being long at the head of society
in Edinburgh, died in November 1759, having survived her
second husband twelve years. It was remembered of her that
she had been the first person in Edinburgh, of her time, to keep
a black domestic servant.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<h3>OLD BANK CLOSE.</h3>

<p>Amongst the buildings removed to make way for George IV.
Bridge were those of a short blind alley in the Lawnmarket,
called the Old Bank Close. Composed wholly of solid goodly
structures, this close had an air of
dignity that might have almost
reconciled a modern gentleman to
live in it. One of these, crossing
and closing the bottom, had been
the Bank of Scotland&mdash;the <em>Auld
Bank</em>, as it used to be half-affectionately
called in Edinburgh&mdash;previously
to the erection of the
present handsome edifice in Bank
Street. From this establishment
the close had taken its name;
but it had previously been
called <em>Hope’s Close</em>, from
its being the residence
of a son of the celebrated
Sir Thomas
Hope, King’s Advocate
in the reign of
Charles I.</p>

<div class="figcenter w425">
<img src="images/illus_p_070.jpg" width="425" height="445" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">House of Robert Gourlay.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The house of oldest
date in the close was
one on the west side,
of substantial and even handsome appearance, long and lofty,
and presenting some peculiarities of structure nearly unique
in our city. There was first a door for the ground-floor, about
which there was nothing remarkable. Then there was a door
leading by the stair to the <em>first floor</em>, and bearing this legend and
date upon the architrave:</p>

<p class="center">
IN THE IS AL MY TRAIST: 1569.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<p>Close beside this door was another, leading by a longer, but
distinct though adjacent stair to the second floor, and presenting
on the architrave the initials R. G. From this floor
there was an internal stair contained in a projecting turret,
which connected it with the higher floor. Thus, it will be
observed, there were three houses in this building, each having
a distinct access; a nicety of arrangement which, together with
the excellence of the masonry, was calculated to create a more
respectful impression regarding the domestic ideas of our ancestors
in Queen Mary’s time than most persons are prepared for.
Finally, in the triangular space surmounting an attic window
were the initials of a married couple, D. G., M. S.</p>

<p>Our surprise is naturally somewhat increased when we learn
that the builder and first possessor of this house does not
appear to have been a man of rank, or one likely to own
unusual wealth. His name was Robert Gourlay, and his
profession a humble one connected with the law&mdash;namely, that
of a messenger-at-arms. In the second book of Charters in the
Canongate council-house, Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney,
and commendator of Holyrood, gave the office of messenger or
officer-at-arms to the Abbey to Robert Gourlay, messenger, ‘our
lovit familiar servitor,’ with a salary of forty pounds, and other
perquisites. This was the Robert Gourlay who built the noble
tenement in the Old Bank Close; and through his official
functions it came into connection with an interesting historical
event. In May 1581, when the ex-Regent Morton was brought
to Edinburgh to suffer death, he was&mdash;as we learn from the
memoirs of Moyses, a contemporary&mdash;‘lodged in Robert Gourlay’s
house, and there keeped by the waged men.’ Gourlay had been
able to accommodate in his house those whom it was his professional
duty to take in charge as prisoners. Here, then, must
have taken place those remarkable conferences between Morton
and certain clergymen, in which, with the prospect of death
before him, he protested his innocence of Darnley’s death, while
confessing to a foreknowledge of it. Morton must have resided
in the house from May 29, when he arrived in Edinburgh, till
June 2, when he fell under the stroke of the ‘Maiden.’ In the
ensuing year, as we learn from the authority just quoted, De la
Motte, the French ambassador, was lodged in ‘Gourlay’s House.’</p>

<p>David Gourlay&mdash;probably the individual whose initials appeared
on the attic&mdash;described as son of John Gourlay, customer, and
doubtless grandson of the first man Robert&mdash;disposed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
house in 1637 to Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall in liferent, and
to his second son, Sir Thomas Hope of Kerse.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> We may suppose
‘the Advocate’ to have thus provided a mansion for one of his
children. A grandson in 1696 disposed of the upper floor to
Hugh Blair, merchant in Edinburgh&mdash;the grandfather, I presume,
of the celebrated Dr Hugh Blair.</p>

<p>This portion of the house was occupied early in the last
century by Lord Aberuchil, one of King William’s judges,
remarkable for the large fortune he accumulated. About 1780
his descendant, Sir James Campbell of Aberuchil, resided in it
while educating his family. It was afterwards occupied by
Robert Stewart, writer, extensively known in Perthshire by the
name of <em>Rob Uncle</em>, on account of the immense number of his
nephews and nieces, amongst the former of whom was the late
worthy General Stewart of Garth, author of the work on the
Highland regiments.</p>

<p>The building used by the bank was also a substantial one.
Over the architrave was the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
SPES ALTERÆ VITÆ,
</p>

<p>with a device emblematising the resurrection&mdash;namely, a couple
of cross-bones with wheat-stalks springing from them, and the
date 1588. Latterly it was occupied as the University Printing-office,
and when I visited it in 1824 it contained an old wooden
press, which was believed to be the identical one which Prince
Charles carried with him from Glasgow to Bannockburn to print
his gazettes, but then used as a <em>proof-press</em>, like a good hunter
reduced to the sand-cart. This house was removed in 1834,
having been previously sold by the Commissioners of Improvements
for £150. The purchaser got a larger sum for a leaden
roof unexpectedly found upon it. When the house was demolished,
it was discovered that every window-shutter had a communication
by wires with an intricate piece of machinery in the
garret, designed to operate upon a bell hung at a corner on the
outside, so that not a window could have been forced without
giving an alarm.</p>

<p>In the Cowgate, little more than fifty yards from the site of
this building, there is a bulky old mansion, believed to have
been the residence of the celebrated King’s Advocate Hope,
himself, the ancestor of all the considerable men of this name
now in Scotland. One can easily see, amidst all the disgrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
into which it has fallen, something remarkable in this house,
with two entrances from the street, and two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochères</i> leading
to other accesses in the rear. Over one door is the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
TECUM HABITA: 1616;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
</p>

<p>over the other a half-obliterated line, known to have been</p>

<p class="center">

</div>

<p>One often finds significant voices proceeding from the builders
of these old houses, generally to express humility. Sir Thomas
here quotes a well-known
passage in Persius, as if to
tell the beholder to confine
himself to a criticism of
his own house; and then,
with more certain humility,
uses a passage of the
Psalms (cxix. 19): ‘I am
a stranger upon earth,’ the
latter being an anagram of
his own name, thus spelt:
<span class="smcap">Thomas Houpe</span>. It is impossible
without a passing
sensation of melancholy to
behold this house, and to
think how truly the obscurity
of its history, and
the wretchedness into which
it has fallen, realise the
philosophy of the anagram.
Verily, the great statesman
who once lived here in dignity
and the respect of men
was but as a stranger who
tarried in the place for a
night, and was gone.</p>

<p>The <cite>Diary of Sir Thomas Hope</cite>, printed for the Bannatyne
Club (1843), is a curious record of the public duties of a great
law-officer in the age to which it refers, as well as of the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
of worldly and spiritual things in which the venerable dignitary
was engaged. He is indefatigable in his religious duties and
his endeavours to advance the interests of his family; at the
same time full of kindly feeling about his sons’ wives and their
little family matters, never failing, for one thing, to tell how
much the midwife got for her attendance on these ladies. There
are many passages respecting his prayers, and the ‘answers’ he
obtained to them, especially during the agonies of the opening
civil war. He prays, for instance, that the Lord would pity his
people, and then hears the words: ‘I will preserve and saiff my
people’&mdash;‘but quhither be me or some other, I dar not say.’
On another occasion, at the time when the Covenanting army
was mustering for Dunse Law to oppose King Charles, Sir
Thomas tells that, praying: ‘Lord, pitie thy pure [i.e. poor]
kirk, for their is no help in man!’ he heard a voice saying: ‘I
will pitie it;’ ‘for quhilk I blissit the Lord;’ immediately after
which he goes on: ‘Lent to John my <em>long carabin of rowet wark</em>
all indentit;’ &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Countess of Mar, daughter of Esme, Duke of Lennox,
died of a <em>deadly brash</em> in Sir Thomas’s house in the Cowgate,
May 11, 1644.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that the Hopes are one of several
Scottish families, possessing high rank and great wealth, which
trace their descent to merchants in Edinburgh. ‘The Hopes
are of French extraction, from Picardy. It is said they were
originally Houblon, and had their name from the plant [hop],
and not from esperance [the virtue in the mind]. The first that
came over was a domestic of Magdalene of France, queen of
James V.; and of him are descended all the eminent families of
Hopes. This John Hope set up as a merchant of Edinburgh,
and his son, by Bessie or Elizabeth Cumming, is marked as
a member of our first Protestant General Assembly, anno
1560.’<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<h3>CHIESLY OF DALRY.</h3>

<p>The head of the Old Bank Close was the scene of the assassination
of President Lockhart by Chiesly of Dalry,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> March 1689.
The murderer had no provocation besides a simple judicial act
of the president, assigning an aliment or income of £93 out of
his estate to his wife and children, from whom it may be presumed
he had been separated. He evidently was a man abandoned
to the most violent passions&mdash;perhaps not quite sane. In
London, half a year before the deed, he told Mr Stuart, an
advocate, that he was resolved to go to Scotland before Candlemas
and kill the president; when, on Stuart remarking that the
very imagination of such a thing was a sin before God, he
replied: ‘Let God and me alone; we have many things to reckon
betwixt us, and we will reckon this too.’ The judge was informed
of the menaces of Chiesly, but despised them.</p>

<p>On a Sunday afternoon, the last day of March&mdash;the town
being then under the excitement of the siege of the Castle by the
friends of the new government&mdash;Lockhart was walking home
from church to his house in this alley, when Chiesly came behind,
just as he entered the close, and shot him in the back with a
pistol. A Dr Hay, coming to visit the president’s lady, saw his
lordship stagger and fall. The ball had gone through the body,
and out at the right breast. He was taken into his house, laid
down upon two chairs, and almost immediately was a dead man.
Some gentlemen passing seized the murderer, who readily owned
he had done the deed, which he said was ‘to learn the president
to do justice.’ When immediately after informed that his victim
had expired, he said ‘he was not used to do things by halves.’
He boasted of the deed as if it had been some grand exploit.</p>

<p>After torture had been inflicted, to discover if he had any
accomplices, the wretched man was tried by the magistrates of
Edinburgh, and sentenced to be carried on a hurdle to the Cross,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and there hanged, with the fatal pistol hung from his neck, after
which his body was to be suspended in chains at the Gallow
Lee, and his right hand affixed to the West Port. The body
was stolen from the gallows, as was supposed, by his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
and it was never known what had become of it till more than a
century after, when, in removing the hearthstone of a cottage
in Dalry Park, near Edinburgh, a human skeleton was found,
with the remains of a pistol near the situation of the neck. No
doubt was entertained that these were the remains of Chiesly,
huddled into this place for concealment, probably in the course
of the night in which they had been abstracted from the gallows.</p>


<h3>RICH MERCHANTS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY&mdash;SIR
WILLIAM DICK.</h3>

<p>Several houses in the neighbourhood of the Old Bank Close
served to give a respectful notion of the wealth and domestic
state of certain merchants of an early age. Immediately to the
westward, in Brodie’s Close, was the mansion of William Little
of Liberton, bearing date 1570. This was an eminent merchant,
and the founder of a family now represented by Mr Little Gilmour
of the Inch, in whose possession this mansion continued under
entail, till purchased and taken down by the Commissioners of
Improvements in 1836. About 1780 it was the residence of the
notorious Deacon Brodie, of whom something may be said elsewhere.
Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, mentioned a few pages
back as the original owner of the old house in Lady Stair’s Close,
was another affluent trafficker of that age.</p>

<p>In Riddel’s Close, Lawnmarket, there is an enclosed court,
evidently intended to be capable of defence. It is the place where
John Macmoran, a rich merchant of the time of James VI., lived
and carried on his business. In those days even schoolboys
trusted to violence for attaining their ends. The youths of the
High School,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> being malcontent about their holidays, barred themselves
up in the school with some provisions, and threatened not
to surrender till the magistrates should comply with their demands.
John Macmoran, who held the office of one of the bailies, came
with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> to deal with the boys, but, finding them obdurate,
ordered the door to be prised open with a joist. One within then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
fired a pistol at the bailie, who fell shot through the brain, to
the horror of all beholders, including the schoolboys themselves,
who with difficulty escaped
the vengeance of
the crowd assembled on
the spot.</p>

<p>It was ascertained that
the immediate author of
the bailie’s death was
William Sinclair, son of
the chancellor of Caithness.
There was a great
clamour to have justice
done upon him; but this
was a point not easily
attained, where a person
of gentle blood was concerned,
in the reign of
James VI. The boy lived
to be Sir William Sinclair
of Mey, and, as such, was
the ancestor of those who
have, since 1789, borne
the title of Earls of
Caithness.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400">
<img src="images/illus_p_077.jpg" width="400" height="589" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Bailie Macmoran’s House, Riddel’s Court.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A visit to the fine old
mansion of Bailie Macmoran
may be recommended.
Its masonry is
not without elegance.
The lower floor of the
building is now used as
‘The Mechanics’ Library.’<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Macmoran’s house is in the floor
above, reached by a stone stair, near the corner of the court.
This dwelling offers a fine specimen of the better class of
houses at the end of the sixteenth century. The marble jambs
of the fireplaces and the carved stucco ceilings are quite entire.
The larger room (occupied as a warehouse for articles of saddlery)
is that in which took place two memorable royal banquets in
1598&mdash;the first on the 24th of April to James VI. with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
queen, Anne of Denmark, and her brother the Duke of Holstein;
and the second on the 2nd of May, more specially to the Duke
of Holstein, but at which their Majesties were present. These
banquets, held, as Birrel says, with ‘grate solemnitie and mirrines,’
were at the expense of the city. It need hardly be said that
James VI. was fond of this species of entertainment, and the house
of Macmoran was probably selected for the purpose not only
because he was treasurer to the corporation and a man of some
mark, but because his dwelling offered suitable accommodation.
The general aspect of the enclosed court which affords access to
Macmoran’s house has undergone little or no alteration since
these memorable banquets; and in visiting the place, with its
quietude and seclusion, one almost feels as if stepping back into
the sixteenth century. Considering the destruction all around
from city improvements, it is fortunate that this remarkable
specimen of an old mansion should have been left so singularly
entire. One of the higher windows continues to exemplify an
economical arrangement which prevailed about the time of the
Restoration&mdash;namely, to have the lower half composed of wooden
shutters.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The grandest of all these old Edinburgh merchants was William
Dick, ancestor of the Dicks, baronets of Prestonfield. In his
youth, and during the lifetime of his father, he had been able to
lend £6000 to King James, to defray the expense of his journey
to Scotland. The affairs in which he was engaged would even
now be considered important. For example, he farmed the customs
on wine at £6222, and the crown rents of Orkney at £3000.
Afterwards he farmed the excise. His fleets extended from the
Baltic to the Mediterranean. The immense wealth he acquired
enabled him to purchase large estates. He himself reckoned his
property as at one time equal to two hundred thousand pounds
sterling.</p>

<p>Strange to say, this great merchant came to poverty, and died
in a prison. The reader of the Waverley novels may remember
David Deans telling how his father ‘saw them toom the sacks of
dollars out o’ Provost Dick’s window intill the carts that carried
them to the army at Dunse Law’&mdash;‘if ye winna believe his testimony,
there is the window itsell still standing in the Luckenbooths&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
think it’s a claith-merchant’s buith the day.’ This refers
to large advances which Dick made to the Covenanters to enable
them to carry on the war against the king. The house alluded
to is actually now a claith-merchant’s booth, having long been
in the possession of Messrs John Clapperton &amp; Company. Two
years after Dunse Law, Dick gave the Covenanters 100,000 merks
in one sum. Subsequently, being after all of royalist tendencies,
he made still larger advances in favour of the Scottish government
during the time when Charles II. was connected with it; and thus
provoking the wrath of the English Commonwealth, his ruin was
completed by the fines to which he was subjected by that party
when triumphant, amounting in all to £65,000.</p>

<p>Poor Sir William Dick&mdash;for he had been made a baronet by
Charles I.&mdash;went to London to endeavour to recover some part
of his lost means. When he represented the indigence to which
he had been reduced, he was told that he was always able to
procure pie-crust when other men could not get bread. There
was, in fact, a prevalent idea that he possessed some supernatural
means&mdash;such as the philosopher’s stone&mdash;of acquiring money.
(Pie-crust came to be called <em>Sir William Dick’s Necessity</em>.) The
contrary was shown when the unfortunate man died soon after in
a prison in Westminster. There is a picture in Prestonfield
House, near Edinburgh, the seat of his descendant, representing
him in this last retreat in a mean dress, surrounded by his
numerous hapless family. A rare pamphlet, descriptive of his
case, presents engravings of three such pictures; one exhibiting
him on horseback, attended by guards as Lord Provost of Edinburgh,
superintending the unloading of one of his rich ships at
Leith; another as a prisoner in the hands of the bailiffs; the
third as dead in prison. A more memorable example of the
instability of fortune does not occur in our history. It seems
completely to realise the picture in Job (chap. xxvii.): ‘The rich
man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth
his eyes, and he is not. Terrors take hold on him as waters, a
tempest stealeth him away in the night. The east wind carrieth
him away, and he departeth: and as a storm, hurleth him out of
his place. For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he
would fain flee out of his hand. Men shall clap their hands at
him, and shall hiss him out of his place.’</p>

<p>The fortunes of the family were restored by Sir William’s
grandson, Sir James, a remarkably shrewd man, who was likewise
a merchant in Edinburgh. There is a traditionary story that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
this gentleman, observing the utility of manure, and that the
streets of Edinburgh were loaded with it, to the detriment of the
comfort of the inhabitants, offered to relieve the town of this
nuisance on condition that he should be allowed, for a certain
term of years, to carry it away gratis. Consent was given, and
the Prestonfield estate became, in consequence, like a garden.
The Duke of York had a great affection for Sir James Dick, and
used to walk through the Park to visit him at his house very
frequently. Hence, according to the report of the family, the
way his Royal Highness took came to be called <em>The Duke’s
Walk</em>; afterwards a famous resort for the fighting of duels. Sir
James became Catholic, and, while provost in 1681, had his house
burned over his head by the collegianers; but it was rebuilt
at the public expense. His grandson, Sir Alexander Dick, is
referred to in kindly terms in Boswell’s <cite>Tour to the Hebrides</cite>
as a venerable man of studious habits and a friend of men of
letters. The reader will probably learn with some surprise that
though Sir William’s descendants never recovered any of the
money lent by him to the State, a lady of his family, living
in 1844, was in the enjoyment of a pension with express reference
to that ancient claim.</p>


<h3>THE BIRTH OF LORD BROUGHAM.</h3>

<p>[1868.&mdash;It has been remarked elsewhere that, for a great
number of years after the general desertion of the Old Town by
persons of condition, there were many denizens of the New who
had occasion to look back to the Canongate and Cowgate as the
place of their birth. The nativity of one person who achieved
extraordinary greatness and distinction, and whose death was an
occurrence of yesterday, Henry, Lord Brougham, undoubtedly
was connected with the lowly place last mentioned.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh tradition on the subject was that Henry
Brougham, younger, of Brougham Hall, in the county of Cumberland,
in consequence of a disappointment in love, came to Edinburgh
for the diversion of his mind. Principal Robertson, to whom he
bore a letter of introduction, recommended the young man to
the care of his sister&mdash;Mrs Syme, widow of the minister of Alloa&mdash;who
occupied what was then considered as a good and spacious
house at the head of the Cowgate&mdash;strictly the third floor of the
house now marked No. 8&mdash;a house desirable from its having an
extraordinary space in front. Here, it would appear, Mr Brougham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
speedily consoled himself for his former disappointment by falling
in love with Eleonora, the daughter of Mrs Syme; and a marriage,
probably a hurried one, soon united the young pair. They set
up for themselves (Whitsunday 1778) in an upper floor of a house
in the then newly built St Andrew Square, where, in the ensuing
September, their eldest son, charged with so illustrious a destiny,
first saw the light.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Mr Brougham conclusively settled in Edinburgh; he subsequently
occupied a handsome house in George Street. He was
never supposed to be a man of more than ordinary faculties; but
any deficiency in this respect was amply made up for by his wife,
who is represented by all who remember her as a person of uncommon
mental gifts. The contrast of the pair drew the attention
of society, and was the subject of a gently satiric sketch in Henry
Mackenzie’s <cite>Lounger</cite>, No. 45, published on the 10th December
1785, which, however, would vainly be looked for in the reprinted
copies, as it was immediately suppressed.]</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OLD_TOLBOOTH" id="THE_OLD_TOLBOOTH">THE OLD TOLBOOTH.</a></h2>


<p>The genius of Scott has shed a peculiar interest upon this
ancient structure, whose cant name of the <cite>Heart of Mid-Lothian</cite>
has given a title to one of his happiest novels. It stood
in a singular situation, occupying half the width of the High
Street, elbow to elbow, as it were, with St Giles’s Church. Antique
in form, gloomy and haggard in aspect, its black stanchioned
windows opening through its dingy walls like the apertures of a
hearse, it was calculated to impress all beholders with a due and
deep sense of what was meant in Scottish law by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">squalor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
carceris</i>. At the west end was a projecting ground-floor, formed
of shops, but presenting a platform on which executions took
place. The building itself was composed of two parts, one more
solid and antique than the other, and much resembling, with its
turret staircase, one of those tall, narrow fortalices which are so
numerous in the Border counties. Indeed, the probability is that
this had been a kind of peel or house of defence, required for
public purposes by the citizens of Edinburgh when liable to predatory
invasions. Doubtless the house or some part of it was of
great antiquity, for it was an old and ruinous building in the
reign of Mary, and only narrowly saved at that time from
destruction. Most likely it was the very <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pretorium burgi de
Edinburgi</i> in which a parliament assembled in 1438 to deliberate
on the measures rendered necessary by the assassination of the
poet-king, James I. In those simple days great and humble
things came close together: the house which contained parliaments
upstairs, presented shops in the lower story, and thus drew in a
little revenue to the magistrates. Here met the Court of Session
in its earliest years. Here Mary assembled her parliaments; and
here&mdash;on the Tolbooth door&mdash;did citizens affix libels by night,
charging the Earl of Bothwell with the murder of Darnley.
Long, long since all greatness had been taken away from the old
building, and it was condemned to be a jail alone, though still
with shops underneath. At length, in 1817, the fabric was wholly
swept away, in consequence of the erection of a better jail on
the Calton Hill. The gateway, with the door and padlock, was
transferred to Abbotsford, and, with strange taste on the part of
the proprietor, built into a conspicuous part of that mansion.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600">
<a id="illus_c_009"></a>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_83">Page 83.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The principal entrance to the Tolbooth, and the only one used
in later days, was at the bottom of the turret next the church.
The gateway was of tolerably good carved stone-work, and occupied
by a door of ponderous massiness and strength, having, besides
the lock, a flap-padlock, which, however, was generally kept
unlocked during the day. In front of the door there always
paraded, or rather loitered, a private of the town-guard, with his
rusty red clothes and Lochaber axe or musket. The door adjacent
to the principal gateway was, in the final days of the Tolbooth,
‘<span class="smcap">Michael Ketten’s Shoe-shop</span>,’ but had formerly been a <em>thief’s
hole</em>. The next door to that, stepping westward, was the residence
of the turnkey; a dismal, unlighted den, where the gray old man
was always to be found, when not engaged in unlocking or closing
the door. The next door westward was a lock-up house, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
in later times was never used. On the north side, towards the
street, there had once been shops, which were let by the magistrates;
but these were converted, about the year 1787, into a
guard-house for the city-guard, on their ancient capitol in the
High Street being destroyed for the levelling of the streets. The
ground-floor, thus occupied for purposes in general remote from
the character of the building, was divided lengthwise by a strong
partition wall; and communication between the rooms above and
these apartments below was effectually interdicted by the strong
arches upon which the superstructure was reared.</p>

<p>On passing the outer door&mdash;where the rioters of 1736 thundered
with their sledge-hammers, and finally burnt down all that interposed
between them and their prey&mdash;the keeper instantly involved
the entrant in darkness by reclosing the gloomy portal. A flight
of about twenty steps then led to an inner door, which, being duly
knocked at, was opened by a bottle-nosed personage, denominated
Peter, who, like his sainted namesake, always carried two or three
large keys. You then entered <em>the Hall</em>, which, being free to all
the prisoners except those of the <em>East End</em>, was usually filled with
a crowd of shabby-looking but very merry loungers. A small rail
here served as an additional security, no prisoner being permitted
to come within its pale. Here also a sentinel of the city-guard
was always walking, having a bayonet or ramrod in his hand. The
<em>Hall</em>, being also the chapel of the jail, contained an old pulpit of
singular fashion&mdash;such a pulpit as one could imagine John Knox
to have preached from; which, indeed, he was traditionally said to
have actually done. At the right-hand side of the pulpit was a
door leading up the large turnpike to the apartments occupied
by the criminals, one of which was of plate-iron. The door was
always shut, except when food was taken up to the prisoners. On
the west end of the hall hung a board, on which were inscribed
the following emphatic lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A prison is a house of care,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A place where none can thrive,</div>
<div class="verse">A touchstone true to try a friend,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A grave for men alive&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sometimes a place of right,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sometimes a place of wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes a place for jades and thieves,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And honest men among.’<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span></p>
<p>A part of the hall on the north side was partitioned off into
two small rooms, one of which was the captain’s pantry, the other
his counting-room. In the latter hung an old musket or two, a
pair of obsolete bandoleers, and a sheath of a bayonet, intended,
as one might suppose, for his defence against a mutiny of the
prisoners. Including the space thus occupied, the hall was
altogether twenty-seven feet long by about twenty broad. The
height of the room was twelve feet. Close to the door, and within
the rail, was a large window, thickly stanchioned; and at the other
end of the hall, within the captain’s two rooms, was a double
window of a somewhat extraordinary character. Tradition, supported
by the appearance of the place, pointed out this as having
formerly been a door by which royalty entered the hall in the
days when it was the Parliament House. It is said that a kind
of bridge was thrown between this aperture and a house on the
other side of the street, and that the sovereign, having prepared
himself in that house to enter the hall in his state robes, proceeded
at the proper time along the arch&mdash;an arrangement by no means
improbable in those days of straitened accommodation.</p>

<p>The window on the south side of the hall overlooked the outer
gateway. It was therefore employed by the inner turnkey as a
channel of communication with his exterior brother when any
visitor was going out. He used to cry over this window, in the
tone of a military order upon parade: ‘<em>Turn your hand</em>,’ whereupon
the gray-haired man on the pavement below opened the door
and permitted the visitor, who by this time had descended the
stair, to walk out.</p>

<p>The floor immediately above the hall was occupied by one room
for felons, having a bar along part of the floor, to which condemned
criminals were chained, and a square box of plate-iron in the
centre, called <span class="smcap lowercase">THE CAGE</span>, which was said to have been constructed
for the purpose of confining some extraordinary culprit who had
broken half the jails in the kingdom. Above this room was
another of the same size, also appropriated to felons.</p>

<p>The larger and western part of the edifice, of coarser and
apparently more modern construction, contained four floors, all of
which were appropriated to the use of debtors, except a part of
the lowest one, where a middle-aged woman kept a tavern for the
sale of malt liquors. A turnpike stair gave access to the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
floors. As it was narrow, steep, and dark, the visitor was assisted
in his ascent by a greasy rope, which, some one was sure to inform
him afterwards, had been employed in hanging a criminal. In
one of the apartments on the second floor was a door leading out
to the platform whereon criminals were executed, and in another,
on the floor above, was an ill-plastered part of the wall covering
the aperture through which the gallows was projected. The
fourth flat was a kind of barrack, for the use of the poorest
debtors.</p>

<p>There was something about the Old Tolbooth which would have
enabled a blindfolded person led into it to say that it was a jail.
It was not merely odorous from the ordinary causes of imperfect
drainage, but it had poverty’s own smell&mdash;the odour of human
misery. And yet it did not seem at first a downcast scene. The
promenaders in the hall were sometimes rather merry, cutting
jokes perhaps upon Peter’s nose, or chatting with friends on the
benches regarding the news of the day. Then Mrs Laing drove a
good trade in her little tavern; and if any messenger were sent
out for a bottle of whisky&mdash;why, Peter never searched pockets.
New men were hailed with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Welcome, welcome, brother debtor,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To this poor but merry place;</div>
<div class="verse">Here nor bailiff, dun, nor fetter,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Dare to show his gloomy face.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They would be abashed at first, and the first visit of wife or
daughter, coming shawled and veiled, and with timorous glances,
into the room where the loved object was trying to become at
ease with his companions, was always a touching affair. But it
was surprising how soon, in general, all became familiar, easy, and
even to appearance happy. Each had his story to tell, and sympathy
was certain and liberal. The whole management was of a
good-natured kind, as far as a regard to regulations would allow.
It did not seem at all an impossible thing that a debtor should
accommodate some even more desolate friend with a share of his
lodging for the night, or for many nights, as is said to have been
done in some noted instances, to which we shall presently come.</p>

<p>It was natural for a jail of such old standing to have passed
through a great number of odd adventures, and have many strange
tales connected with it. One of the most remarkable traits of its
character was a sad liability to the failure of its ordinary powers
of retention when men of figure were in question. The old house
had something like that faculty attributed by Falstaff to the lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
and himself&mdash;of knowing men who ought not to be too roughly
handled. The consequence was that almost every criminal of
rank confined in it made his escape. Lord Burleigh, an insane
peer, who, about the time of the Union, assassinated a schoolmaster
who had married a girl to whom he had paid improper addresses,
escaped, while under sentence of death, by changing clothes with
his sister. Several of the rebel gentlemen confined there in 1716
were equally fortunate; a fact on which there was lately thrown
a flood of light, when I found, in a manuscript list of subscriptions
for the relief of the other rebel gentlemen at Carlisle, the name of
the Guidman of the Tolbooth&mdash;so the chief-keeper was called&mdash;down
for a good sum. I am uncertain to which of all these
personages the following anecdote, related to me by Sir Walter
Scott, refers.</p>

<p>It was contrived that the prisoner should be conveyed out of
the Tolbooth in a trunk, and carried by a porter to Leith, where
some sailors were to be ready with a boat to take him aboard a
vessel about to leave Scotland. The plot succeeded so far as the
escape from jail was concerned, but was knocked on the head by
an unlucky and most ridiculous accident. It so happened that
the porter, in arranging the trunk upon his back, placed the end
which corresponded with the feet of the prisoner <em>uppermost</em>. The
head of the unfortunate man was therefore pressed against the
lower end of the box, and had to sustain the weight of the whole
body. The posture was the most uneasy imaginable. Yet life
was preferable to ease. He permitted himself to be taken away.
The porter trudged along with the trunk, quite unconscious of its
contents, and soon reached the High Street. On gaining the
Netherbow he met an acquaintance, who asked him where he was
going with that large burden. To Leith, was the answer. The
other inquired if the job was good enough to afford a potation
before proceeding farther upon so long a journey. This being
replied to in the affirmative, and the carrier of the box feeling in
his throat the philosophy of his friend’s inquiry, it was agreed
that they should adjourn to a neighbouring tavern. Meanwhile,
the third party, whose inclinations had not been consulted in this
arrangement, was wishing that it were at once well over with him
in the Grassmarket. But his agonies were not destined to be of
long duration. The porter in depositing him upon the causeway
happened to make the end of the trunk come down with such
precipitation that, unable to bear it any longer, the prisoner
screamed out, and immediately after fainted. The consternation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
of the porter on hearing a noise from his burden was of course
excessive; but he soon recovered presence of mind enough to conceive
the occasion. He proceeded to unloose and to burst open
the trunk, when the hapless nobleman was discovered in a state of
insensibility. As a crowd collected immediately, and the city-guard
were not long in coming forward, there was of course no
further chance of escape. The prisoner did not recover from his
swoon till he had been safely deposited in his old quarters; but,
if I recollect rightly, he eventually escaped in another way.</p>

<p>In two very extraordinary instances an escape from justice has,
strange as it may appear, been effected by <em>means</em> of the Old Tolbooth.
At the discovery of the Rye-House Plot, in the reign of
Charles II., the notorious Robert Fergusson, usually styled ‘The
Plotter,’ was searched for in Edinburgh, with a view to his being
subjected, if possible, to the extreme vengeance of the law. It
being known almost certainly that he was in town, the authorities
shut the gates, and calculated securely upon having him safe
within their toils. The Plotter, however, by an expedient worthy
of his ingenious character, escaped by taking refuge in the Old
Tolbooth. A friend of his happened to be confined there at
the time, and was able to afford protection and concealment to
Fergusson, who, at his leisure, came abroad, and betook himself to
a place of safer shelter on the Continent. The same device was
practised in 1746 by a gentleman who had been concerned in the
Rebellion, and for whom a hot search had been carried on in the
Highlands.</p>

<p>The case of Katherine Nairne, in 1766, excited in no small
degree the attention of the Scottish public. This lady was allied,
both by blood and marriage, to some respectable families. Her
crime was the double one of poisoning her husband and having
an intrigue with his brother, who was her associate in the murder.
On her arrival at Leith in an open boat, her whole bearing betrayed
so much levity, or was so different from what had been expected,
that the mob raised a cry of indignation, and were on the point of
pelting her, when she was with some difficulty rescued from their
hands by the public authorities. In this case the Old Tolbooth
found itself, as usual, incapable of retaining a culprit of condition.
Sentence had been delayed by the judges on account of the lady’s
pregnancy. The midwife employed at her accouchement (who continued
to practise in Edinburgh so lately as the year 1805) had
the address to achieve a jail-delivery also. For three or four days
previous to that concerted for the escape, she pretended to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
afflicted with a prodigious toothache, went out and in with her
head enveloped in shawls and flannels, and groaned as if she had
been about to give up the ghost. At length, when the Peter of
that day had become so habituated to her appearance as not very
much to heed her exits and her entrances, Katherine Nairne one
evening came down in her stead, with her head wrapped all round
with the shawls, uttering the usual groans, and holding down her
face upon her hands, as with agony, in the precise way customary
with the midwife. The inner doorkeeper, not quite unconscious,
it is supposed, of the trick, gave her a hearty thump upon the
back as she passed out, calling her at the same time a howling old
Jezebel, and wishing she would never come back to trouble him
any more. There are two reports of the proceedings of Katherine
Nairne after leaving the prison. One bears that she immediately
left the town in a coach, to which she was handed by a friend
stationed on purpose. The coachman, it is said, had orders from
her relations, in the event of a pursuit, to drive into the sea, that
she might drown herself&mdash;a fate which was considered preferable
to the ignominy of a public execution. The other story runs
that she went up the Lawnmarket to the Castle-hill, where lived
Mr &mdash;&mdash;, a respectable advocate, from whom, as he was her cousin,
she expected to receive protection. Being ignorant of the town,
she mistook the proper house, and applied at that of the crown
agent,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> who was assuredly the last man in the world that could
have done her any service. As good luck would have it, she was
not recognised by the servant, who civilly directed her to her
cousin’s house, where, it is said, she remained concealed many weeks.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Her future life, it has been reported, was virtuous and fortunate.
She was married to a French gentleman, became the mother of a
large family, and died at a good old age. Meanwhile, Patrick
Ogilvie, her associate in the dark crime which threw a shade over
her younger years, suffered in the Grassmarket. He had been a
lieutenant in the &mdash;&mdash; regiment, and was so much beloved by his
fellow-soldiers, who happened to be stationed at that time in
Edinburgh Castle, that the public authorities judged it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
to shut them up in a fortress till the execution was over lest they
might have attempted a rescue.</p>

<p>The Old Tolbooth was the scene of the suicide of Mungo
Campbell while under sentence of death (1770) for shooting the
Earl of Eglintoune. In the district where this memorable event
took place, it is somewhat remarkable that the fate of the murderer
was more generally lamented than that of the murdered person.
Campbell, though what was called ‘a graceless man,’ was rather
popular in his profession of exciseman, on account of his rough,
honourable spirit, and his lenity in the matter of smuggling.
Lord Eglintoune, on the contrary, was not liked, on account of
his improving mania, which had proved a serious grievance to the
old-fashioned farmers of Kyle and Cunningham. There was one
article, called rye-grass, which he brought in amongst them, and
forced them to cultivate; and black prelacy itself had hardly, a
century before, been a greater evil. Then, merely to stir them up
a little, he would cause them to exchange farms with each other;
thus giving their ancient plenishings, what was doubtless much
wanted, an airing, but also creating a strong sense that Lord
Eglintoune was ‘far ower fashious.’ His lordship had excited
some scandal by his private habits, which helped in no small
degree to render unpopular one who was in reality an amiable and
upright gentleman. He was likewise somewhat tenacious about
matters respecting game&mdash;the besetting weakness of British gentlemen
in all ages. On the other hand, Campbell, though an austere
and unsocial man, acted according to popular ideas both in respect
of the game and excise laws. The people felt that he was on their
side; they esteemed him for his integrity in the common affairs of
life, and even in some degree for his birth and connections, which
were far from mean. It was also universally believed, though
erroneously, that he had only discharged his gun by accident, on
falling backward, while retreating before his lordship, who had
determined to take it from him. In reality, Mungo, after his fall,
rose on his elbow and wilfully shot the poor earl, who had given
him additional provocation by bursting into a laugh at his awkward
fall. The Old Tolbooth was supposed by many, at the time, to
have had her usual failing in Mungo’s case. The interest of the
Argyll family was said to have been employed in his favour; and
the body which was found suspended over the door, instead of
being his, was thought to be that of a dead soldier from the Castle
substituted in his place. His relations, however, who were very
respectable people in Ayrshire, all acknowledged that he died by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
his own hand; and this was the general idea of the mob of Edinburgh,
who, getting the body into their hands, dragged it down
the street to the King’s Park, and, inspired by different sentiments
from those of the Ayrshire people, were not satisfied till they got
it up to the top of Salisbury Crags, from which they precipitated
it down the <em>Cat Nick</em>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Deacon Brodie’s
Keys and

</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable criminals ever confined in the
Old Tolbooth was the noted William Brodie. This was a man
of respectable connections, and who had moved in good society
all his life, unsuspected of any criminal pursuits. It is said that
a habit of frequenting cock-pits was the first symptom he
exhibited of a decline from rectitude. His ingenuity as a
mechanic gave him a fatal facility in the burglarious pursuits to
which he afterwards addicted himself. It was then customary for
the shopkeepers of Edinburgh to hang their keys upon a nail at
the back of their doors, or at least to take no pains in concealing
them during the day. Brodie used to take impressions of them
in putty or clay, a piece of which he would carry in the palm of
his hand. He kept a blacksmith in his pay, who forged exact
copies of the keys he wanted, and with these it was his custom to
open the shops of his fellow-tradesmen during the night. He
thus found opportunities of securely stealing whatever he wished
to possess. He carried on his malpractices for many years, and
never was suspected till, having committed a daring
robbery upon the Excise Office in Chessels’s Court,
Canongate, some circumstances transpired which induced
him to disappear from Edinburgh. Suspicion
then becoming strong, he was pursued to Holland,
and taken at Amsterdam, standing upright in a press
or cupboard. At his trial, Henry Erskine, his
counsel, spoke very eloquently in his behalf, representing,
in particular, to the jury how strange and improbable a
circumstance it was that a man whom they had themselves
known from infancy as a person of good repute
should have been guilty of such practices as those with
which he was charged. He was, however, found guilty,
and sentenced to death, along with his accomplice
Smith. At the trial he had appeared in a full-dress
suit of black clothes, the greater part of which was
of silk, and his deportment throughout the affair was
composed and gentlemanlike. He continued during
the period which intervened between his sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
and execution to dress well and keep up his spirits. A
gentleman of his acquaintance, calling upon him in the
condemned room, was surprised to find him singing the song
from the <cite>Beggars’ Opera</cite>, ‘’Tis woman seduces all mankind.’
Having contrived to cut out the figure of a draughtboard on the
stone floor of his dungeon, he amused himself by playing with
any one who would join him, and, in default of such, with his
right hand against his left. This diagram remained in the room
where it was so strangely out of place till the destruction of the
jail. His dress and deportment at the gallows (October 1, 1788)
displayed a mind at ease, and gave some countenance to the
popular notion that he had made certain mechanical arrangements
for saving his life. Brodie was the first who proved the
excellence of an improvement he
had formerly made on the apparatus
of the gibbet. This was
the substitution of what is called
the <em>drop</em> for the ancient practice of
the double ladder. He inspected
the thing with a professional air,
and seemed to view the result of his
ingenuity with a smile of satisfaction.
When placed on that insecure
pedestal, and while the rope
was adjusted round his neck by the
executioner, his courage did not
forsake him. On the contrary, even
there he exhibited a sort of levity;
he shuffled about, looked gaily
around, and finally went out of the
world with his hand stuck carelessly
into the open front of his vest.</p>

</div>

<p>As its infirmities increased with
old age, the Tolbooth showed itself
incapable of retaining prisoners of
even ordinary rank. Within the
recollection of people living not
long ago, a youth named Hay, the son of a stabler in the
Grassmarket, and who was under sentence of death for burglary,
effected his escape in a way highly characteristic of the Heart
of Mid-Lothian, and of the simple and unprecise system upon
which all public affairs were managed before the present age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>A few days before that appointed for the execution, the father
went up to the condemned room, apparently to condole with his
unhappy son. The irons had been previously got quit of by
files. At nightfall, when most visitors had left the jail, old Hay
invited the inner turnkey, or man who kept the hall-door, to
come into the room and partake of some liquor which he had
brought with him. The man took a few glasses, and became
mellow just about the time when the bottle was exhausted and
when the time of locking up the jail (ten o’clock at that period)
was approaching. Hay expressed unwillingness to part at the
moment when they were just beginning to enjoy their liquor;
a sentiment in which the turnkey heartily sympathised. Hay
took a crown from his pocket, and proposed that his friend
should go out and purchase a bottle of good rum at a neighbouring
shop. The man consented, and staggering away downstairs,
neglected to lock the inner door behind him. Young
Hay followed close, as had been concerted, and after the man
had gone out, and the outer turnkey had closed the outer door,
stood in the stair just within that dread portal, ready to spring
into the street. Old Hay then put his head to the great window
of the hall, and cried: ‘Turn your hand!’&mdash;the usual drawling
cry which brought the outer turnkey to open the door. The
turnkey came mechanically at the cry, and unclosed the outer
door, when the young criminal sprang out, and ran as fast as he
could down Beth’s Wynd, a lane opposite the jail. According
to the plan which had been previously concerted, he repaired
to a particular part of the wall of the Greyfriars Churchyard,
near the lower gate, where it was possible for an agile person to
climb up and spring over; and so well had every stage of the
business been planned that a large stone had been thrown down
at this place to facilitate the leap.</p>

<p>The youth had been provided with a key which could open
Sir George Mackenzie’s mausoleum&mdash;a place of peculiar horror,
as it was supposed to be haunted by the spirit of the bloody
persecutor; but what will not be submitted to for dear life?
Having been brought up in Heriot’s Hospital, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the churchyard, Hay had many boyish acquaintances
still residing in that establishment. Some of these he
contrived to inform of his situation, enjoining them to be secret,
and beseeching them to assist him in his distress. The Herioters
of those days had a very clannish spirit&mdash;insomuch that to have
neglected the interests or safety of any individual of the community,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
however unworthy he might be of their friendship, would
have been looked upon by them as a sin of the deepest dye. Hay’s
confidants, therefore, considered
themselves bound
to assist him by all means
in their power. They
kept his secret faithfully,
spared from their own
meals as much food as
supported him, and ran
the risk of severe punishment,
as well as of seeing
eldritch sights, by visiting
him every night in
his dismal abode. About
six weeks after his escape
from jail, when the hue
and cry had in a great
measure subsided, he ventured
to leave the tomb,
and it was afterwards
known that he escaped
abroad.</p>

<p>A portion of the High Street facing St Giles’s Church was
called the <em>Luckenbooths</em>, and the appellation was shared
with a middle row of buildings which once burdened the street
at that spot. The name is
supposed to have been conferred
on the shops in that situation
as being
<em>close shops</em>, to
distinguish
them from the
open booths
which then
lined our great

would seem to
imply a certain
superiority in
the ancient
merchants of the Luckenbooths; and it is somewhat remarkable
that amidst all the changes of the Old Town there is still in this
limited locality an unusual proportion of mercers and clothiers of
old standing and reputed substantiality.</p>

<p>Previous to 1811, there remained unchanged in this place
two tall massive houses, about two centuries old, one of which
contained the town mansion of Sir John Byres of Coates, a
gentleman of figure in Edinburgh in the reign of James VI.,
and whose faded tombstone may yet be deciphered in the west
wall of the Greyfriars Churchyard. The Byreses of the Coates
died out towards the end of the last century, and their estate
has since become a site for streets, as our city spread westwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
The name alone survives in connection with an alley beneath
their town mansion&mdash;<em>Byres’s Close</em>.</p>


<h3>LORD COALSTOUN AND HIS WIG.</h3>

<p>The <em>fourth floor</em>, constituting the Byres mansion, after being
occupied by such persons as Lord Coupar, Lord Lindores, and
Sir James Johnston of Westerhall, fell into the possession of
Mr Brown of Coalstoun, a judge under the designation of Lord
Coalstoun, and the father of the late Countess of Dalhousie.
His lordship lived here in 1757, but then removed to a more
spacious mansion on the Castle-hill.</p>

<p>A strange accident one morning befell Lord Coalstoun while
residing in this house. It was at that time the custom for
advocates, and no less for judges, to dress themselves in gown,
wig, and cravat at their own houses, and to walk in a sort of
state, thus rigged out, with their cocked hats in their hands, to
the Parliament House.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> They usually breakfasted early, and
when dressed would occasionally lean over their parlour windows,
for a few minutes before St Giles’s bell sounded the starting peal
of a quarter to nine, enjoying the morning air, such as it was,
and perhaps discussing the news of the day, or the convivialities
of the preceding evening, with a neighbouring advocate on the
opposite side of the alley. It so happened that one morning,
while Lord Coalstoun was preparing to enjoy his matutinal treat,
two girls, who lived in the second floor above, were amusing themselves
with a kitten, which, in thoughtless sport, they had swung
over the window by a cord tied round its middle, and hoisted
for some time up and down, till the creature was getting rather
desperate with its exertions. In this crisis his lordship popped
his head out of the window directly below that from which the
kitten swung, little suspecting, good easy man, what a danger
impended, like the sword of Damocles, over his head, hung, too,
by a single&mdash;not <em>hair</em>, ’tis true, but scarcely more responsible
material&mdash;<em>garter</em>, when down came the exasperated animal at
full career directly upon his senatorial wig. No sooner did the
girls perceive what sort of a landing-place their kitten had found
than, in terror and surprise, they began to draw it up; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
measure was now too late, for along with the animal up also came
the judge’s wig, fixed full in its determined talons. His lordship’s
surprise on finding his wig lifted off his head was much increased
when, on looking up, he perceived it dangling its way upwards,
without any means visible to him by which its motions might
be accounted for. The astonishment, the dread, the almost <em>awe</em>
of the senator below&mdash;the half mirth, half terror of the girls
above&mdash;together with the fierce and relentless energy of retention
on the part of Puss between&mdash;altogether formed a scene
to which language could not easily do justice. It was a joke
soon explained and pardoned; but assuredly the perpetrators
of it did afterwards get many lengthened injunctions from their
parents never again to fish over the window, with such a bait, for
honest men’s wigs.</p>


<h3>COMMENDATOR BOTHWELL’S HOUSE.</h3>

<p>The eastern of the tenements, which has only been renovated
by a new front, formerly was the lodging of Adam Bothwell,
Commendator of Holyrood, who is remarkable for having performed
the Protestant marriage ceremony for Mary and the Earl
of Bothwell. This ecclesiastic, who belonged to an old Edinburgh
family of note, and was the uncle of the inventor of
logarithms,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> is celebrated in his epitaph in Holyrood Chapel as
a judge, and the son and father of judges. His son was raised
to the peerage in 1607, under the title of Lord Holyroodhouse,
the lands of that abbacy, with some others, being erected into
a temporal lordship in his favour. The title, however, sunk in
the second generation. The circumstance which now gives
most interest to the family is one which they themselves would
probably have regarded as its greatest disgrace. Among the old
Scottish songs is one which breaks upon the ear with the wail
of wronged womanhood, mingled with the breathings of its indestructible
affections:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Thy mourning makes my heart full sad....</div>
<div class="verse">Baloo, my boy, weep not for me,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose greatest grief’s for wranging thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor pity her deserved smart,</div>
<div class="verse">Who can blame none but her fond heart.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>

<div class="verse">But now perhaps thy curse and mine</div>
<div class="verse">Makes him eat acorns with the swine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nay, curse not him; perhaps now he,</div>

<div class="verse">Perhaps at death, for who can tell</div>
<div class="verse">But the great Judge of heaven and hell</div>
<div class="verse">By some proud foe has struck the blow,</div>
<div class="verse">And laid the dear deceiver low,’ &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Great doubt has long rested on the history of this piteous ditty;
but it is now ascertained to have been a contemporary effusion
on the sad love-tale of Anne Bothwell, a sister of the first Lord
Holyroodhouse. The only error in the setting down of the
song was in calling it <em>Lady</em> Anne Bothwell’s Lament, as the
heroine had no pretension to a term implying noble rank. Her
lover was a youth of uncommon elegance of person, the Honourable
Alexander Erskine, brother of the Earl of Mar, of the first
Earl of Buchan, and of Lord Cardross. A portrait of him,
which belonged to his mother (the countess mentioned a few pages
back), and which is now in the possession of James Erskine, Esq.
of Cambo, Lady Mar’s descendant, represents him as strikingly
handsome, with much vivacity of countenance, dark-blue eyes, a
peaked beard, and moustaches. The lovers were cousins. The song
is an evidence of the public interest excited by the affair: a fragment
of it found its way into an English play of the day, Broom’s
comedy of <cite>The Northern Lass</cite> (1632). This is somewhat different
from any of the stanzas in the common versions of the ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse">‘Peace, wayward bairn. Oh cease thy moan!</div>
<div class="wideverse">Thy far more wayward daddy’s gone,</div>
<div class="wideverse">And never will recallèd be,</div>
<div class="wideverse">By cries of either thee or me;</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">For should we cry,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">Until we die,</div>
<div class="wideverse">We could not scant his cruelty.</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">Baloo, baloo, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse">He needs might in himself foresee</div>
<div class="wideverse">What thou successively mightst be;</div>
<div class="wideverse">And could he then (though me forego)</div>
<div class="wideverse">His infant leave, ere he did know</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">How like the dad</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">Would prove the lad,</div>
<div class="wideverse">In time to make fond maidens glad.</div>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span></p>
<p>The fate of the deceiver proved
a remarkable echo of some of the
verses of the ballad. Having
carried his military experience and
the influence of his rank into the
party of the Covenanters, he was
stationed (1640) with his brother-in-law,
the Earl of Haddington, at Dunglass
Castle, on the way to Berwick,
actively engaged in bringing up levies
for the army, then newly advanced
across the Tweed; when, by the revenge
of an offended page, who applied
a hot poker to the powder
magazine, the place was blown up.
Erskine, with his brother-in-law and
many other persons, perished. A
branch of the Mar family retained,
till no remote time, the awe-mingled
feeling which had been produced by
this event, which they had been led
to regard as a punishment inflicted
for the wrongs of Anne Bothwell.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Byres’s Close, Back of
Commendator Bothwell’s House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the back of the Commendator’s
house there is a projection,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> on the
top of which is a bartisan or flat
roof, faced with three lettered stones.
There is a tradition that Oliver
Cromwell lived in this house,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and
used to come out and sit here to view
his navy on the Forth, of which,
together with the whole coast, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
commands a view. As this commander is said to have had his
guard-house in the neighbouring alley called Dunbar’s Close,
there is some reason to give credit to the story, though it is
in no shape authenticated by historical record. The same house
was, for certain, the residence of Sir William Dick, the hapless
son of Crœsus spoken of in a preceding article.</p>

<p>These houses preserved, until their recent renovation, all the
characteristics of that ancient mode of architecture which has
procured for the edifices constructed upon it the dignified appellative
of <em>Mahogany Lands</em>. Below were the booths or piazzas,
once prevalent throughout the whole town, in which the merchants
of the laigh shops, or cellars, were permitted to exhibit their goods
to the passengers. The merchant himself took his seat at the
head of the stair to attend to the wants of passing customers.
By the ancient laws of the burgh, it was required that each should
be provided with ‘lang wappinis, sick as a spear or a Jeddart
staff,’ with which he was to sally forth and assist the magistrates
in time of need; for example, when a <em>tulzie</em> took place between
the retainers of rival noblemen meeting in the street.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300">
<img src="images/illus_p_100.jpg" width="300" height="194" alt="Picture of two pigs at bottom of staircase." />
</div>

<p>This house could also boast of that distinguished feature in all
ancient wooden structures, a <em>fore-stair</em>, an antiquated convenience,
or inconvenience, now almost extinct, consisting of a flight of
steps, ascending from the
pavement to the first floor
of the mansion, and protruding
a considerable way
into the street. Nuisances
as they still are, they were
once infinitely worse. What
will my readers think when
they are informed that
under these projections our
ancestors kept their swine?
Yes; <em>outside stairs</em> was formerly
but a term of outward
respect for what were
as frequently denominated
<em>swine’s cruives</em>; and the rude inhabitants of these narrow mansions
were permitted, through the day, to stroll about the ‘High Gait,’
seeking what they might devour among the heaps of filth which
then encumbered the street,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> as barn-door fowls are at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
day suffered to go abroad in country towns; and, like them (or
like the town-geese of Musselburgh, which to this day are privileged
to feed upon the race-ground), the sullen porkers were regularly
called home in the evening by their respective proprietors.</p>

<p>These circumstances will be held as sufficient evidence, notwithstanding
all the enactments for the ‘policy of bigginis’ and
‘decoring the tounes,’ that the stranger’s constant reproach of
the Scots for want of cleanliness was not unmerited. Yet, to
show that our countrymen did not lack a taste for decent appearances,
let it be recollected that on every occasion of a public
procession, entry of a sovereign, or other ceremonial, these fore-stairs
were hung with carpets, tapestry, or arras, and were the
principal places for the display of rank and fashion; while the
windows, like the galleries of a theatre compared with the boxes,
were chiefly occupied by spectators of a lower degree.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
strictest proclamations were always issued, before any such occasion,
ordaining the ‘middinis’ and the ‘swine’ to be removed, and the
stairs to be decorated in the manner mentioned.</p>

<p>Beneath the stair of the house now under review there abode
in later times an old man named Bryce, in whose life and circumstances
there was something characteristic of a pent-up city like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
Edinburgh, where every foot of space was valuable. A stock of
small hardwares and trinkets was piled up around him, leaving
scarcely sufficient room for the accommodation of his own person,
which completely filled the vacant space, as a hermit-crab fills its
shell. There was not room for the admission of a customer; but
he had a <em>half-door</em>, over which he sold any article that was
demanded; and there he sat from morning till night, with his
face turned to this door, looking up the eternal Lawnmarket.
The place was so confined that he could not stand upright in it;
nor could he stretch out his legs. Even while he sat, there was
an uneasy obliquity of the stair, which compelled him to shrink
a little aside; and by accustoming himself to this posture for a
long series of years, he had insensibly acquired a twist in his
shoulders, nearly approaching to a humpback, and his head
swung a little to one side. This was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’air boutiquier</i> in a most
distressing sense.</p>

<p>In the description of this old tenement given in the title-deeds,
it is called ‘All and haill that Lodging or Timber Land lying in
the burgh of Edinburgh, on the north side of the High Street
thereof, forgainst the place of the Tolbooth, commonly called
the Poor Folks’ Purses.’ The latter place was a part of the
northern wall of the prison, deriving its name from a curious
circumstance. It was formerly the custom for the privileged
beggars, called <em>Blue-gowns</em>, to assemble in the palace yard, where
a small donation from the king, consisting of as many pennies as
he was years old, was conferred on each of them; after which they
moved in procession up the High Street, till they came to this
spot, where the magistrates gave each a <em>leathern purse</em> and a small
sum of money; the ceremony concluding by their proceeding to
the High Church to hear a sermon from one of the king’s
chaplains.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>


<h3>THE KRAMES.</h3>

<p>The central row of buildings&mdash;the <em>Luckenbooths proper</em>&mdash;was
not wholly taken away till 1817. The narrow passage left
between it and the church will ever be memorable to all who
knew Edinburgh in those days, on account of the strange scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
of traffic which it presented&mdash;each recess, angle, and coign of
vantage in the wall of the church being occupied by little shops,
of the nature of Bryce’s, devoted to the sale of gloves, toys,
lollipops, &amp;c. These were the <em>Krames</em>, so famous at Edinburgh
firesides. Singular places of business they assuredly were; often
not presenting more space than a good church-pew, yet supporting
by their commerce respectable citizenly families, from which would
occasionally come men of some consequence in society. At the
same spot the constable (Earl of Errol) was wont to sit upon a
chair at the ridings of the parliament, when ceremonially receiving
the members as they alighted.</p>

<p>I am told that one such place, not more than seven feet by
three, had been occupied by a glover named Kennedy, who with
his gentle dame stood there retailing their wares for a time
sufficient to witness the rise and fall of dynasties, never enjoying
all that time the comfort of a fire, even in the coldest weather!
This was a specimen of the life led by these patient creatures;
many of whom, upon the demolition of their lath and plaster
tenements, retired from business with little competencies. Their
rents were from £3 to £6 per annum; and it appears that,
huddled as the town then was around them, they had no inconsiderable
custom. At the end of the row, under the angle of the
church, was a brief stair, called <em>The Lady’s Steps</em>, thought to be
a corruption of <em>Our Lady’s Steps</em>, with reference to a statue of
the Virgin, the niche for which was seen in the east wall of
the church till the renovation of the building in 1830. Sir
George Mackenzie, however, in his <cite>Observations on the Statutes</cite>,
states that the Lady’s Steps were so called from the infamous
Lady March (wife of the Earl of Arran, James VI.’s profligate
chancellor), from whom also the nine o’clock evening-bell, being
ordered by her to an hour later, came to be called <em>The Lady’s Bell</em>.
When men made bargains at the Cross, it was customary for them
to go up to the Lady’s Steps, and there consummate the negotiation
by wetting thumbs or paying <em>arles</em>.</p>


<h3>CREECH’S SHOP.</h3>

<p>The building at the east end of the Luckenbooths proper had
a front facing down the High Street, and commanding not only
a view of the busy scene there presented, but a prospect of
Aberlady Bay, Gosford House, and other objects in Haddingtonshire.
The shop in the east front was that of Mr Creech, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
bookseller of facete memory, who had published many books by
the principal literary men of his day, to all of whom he was
known as a friend and equal. From this place had issued works
by Kames, Smith, Hume, Mackenzie, and finally the poems of
Burns. It might have been called the Lounger’s Observatory,
for seldom was the doorway free of some group of idlers, engaged
in surveying and commenting on the crowd in front; Creech
himself, with his black silk breeches and powdered head, being
ever a conspicuous member of the corps. The flat above had
been the shop of Allan Ramsay, and the place where, in 1725,
he set up the first example of a circulating library known in
Scotland.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_MEMORANDA_OF_THE_OLD" id="SOME_MEMORANDA_OF_THE_OLD">SOME MEMORANDA OF THE OLD
KIRK OF ST GILES.</a></h2>


<p>The central portion or transept of St Giles’s Church, opening
from the south, formed a distinct place of worship, under
the name of the Old Church, and this seems
to have been the first arranged for Protestant
worship after the Reformation. It was the
scene of the prelections of John Knox (who,
it will be remembered, was the first minister
of the city under the reformed religion),
until a month before his death, when it appears
that another portion of the building&mdash;styled
the Tolbooth Kirk&mdash;was fitted up for
his use.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/illus_p_105a.jpg" width="200" height="228" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">John Knox’s Pulpit.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It also happened to be in the Old Kirk that
the celebrated riot of the 23rd of July 1637
took place, when, on the opening of the new
Episcopal service-book, Jenny Geddes, of
worthy memory, threw her cutty-stool at the
dean who read it&mdash;the first weapon, and a formidable one it was,
employed in the great civil war.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/illus_p_105b.jpg" width="200" height="131" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jenny Geddes’s Stool.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Jenny Geddes was an herbwoman&mdash;<em>Scottice</em>, <em>a greenwife</em>&mdash;at
the Tron Church, where, in former as well as in recent times,
that class of merchants kept their stalls. It
seems that, in the midst of the hubbub,
Jenny, hearing the bishop call upon the dean
to read the <em>collect</em> of the day, cried out, with
unintentional wit: ‘Deil colic the wame o’
ye!’<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and threw at the dean’s head the
small stool on which she sat; ‘a ticket of
remembrance,’ as a Presbyterian annalist
merrily terms it, so well aimed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
clergyman only escaped it by jouking;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that is, by [ducking or]
suddenly bending his person.</p>

<p>Jenny, like the originators of many other insurrections, appears
to have afterwards repented of her exertions on this occasion.
We learn from the simple diarist, Andrew Nichol, that when
Charles II. was known, in June 1650, to have arrived in the
north of Scotland, amidst other rejoicings, ‘the pure [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="quasi dicitur">q.d.</abbr></i> poor]
kaill-wyves at the Trone [Jenny Geddes, no doubt, among the
number] war sae overjoyed, that they sacrificed their standis and
creellis, yea, the verie <em>stoollis</em> they sat on, in ane fyre.’ What
will give, however, a still more unequivocal proof of the repentance
of honest Jenny (after whom, by the way, Burns named a
favourite mare), is the conduct expressly attributed to herself on
the occasion of the king’s coronation in 1661 by the <cite>Mercurius
Caledonius</cite>:</p>

<p>‘But among all our bontados and caprices,’ says that curious
register of events,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> ‘that of the immortal Jenet Geddis, Princesse
of the Trone adventurers, was most pleasant; for she was not
only content to assemble all her Creels, Basquets, <em>Creepies</em>,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Furmes, and other ingredients that composed the Shope of her
Sallets, Radishes, Turnips, Carrots, Spinage, Cabbage, with all
other sorts of Pot Merchandise that belongs to the garden, but
even her Leather Chair of State, where she used to dispense
Justice to the rest of her Langkale Vassals, were all very orderly
burned; she herself countenancing the action with a high-flown
flourish and vermilion majesty.’</p>

<p>The Scottish Society of Antiquaries nevertheless exhibit in their
museum a clasp-stool, for which there is good evidence that it
was the actual stool thrown by Mrs Geddes at the dean.</p>

<p>In the southern aisle of this church, the Regent Murray, three
weeks after his assassination at Linlithgow, February 14, 1569-70,
was interred:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span> ‘his head placed south, contrair the ordour usit;
the sepulchre laid with hewin wark maist curiously, and on the
head ane plate of brass.’ John Knox preached a funeral-sermon
over the remains of his friend, and drew tears from the eyes of
all present. In the Tolbooth Church, immediately adjoining to
the west, sat the convention which chose the Earl of Lennox
as his successor in the regency. Murray’s monument was not
inelegant for the time; and its inscription, written by Buchanan,
is remarkable for emphatic brevity.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/illus_p_107.jpg" width="350" height="447" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Modern Monument to the Marquis of Montrose
(see <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>This part of the church appears to have formerly been an
open lounge. French Paris, Queen Mary’s servant, in his confession
respecting
the murder of Darnley,
mentions that,
during the communings
which took
place before that
deed was determined
on, he one day
‘took his mantle
and sword, and went
to walk (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promener</i>)
in the High Church.’
Probably, in consequence
of the veneration
entertained
for the memory of
‘the Good Regent,’
or else, perhaps,
from some simple
motive of conveniency,
the Earl of
Murray’s tomb was
a place frequently
assigned in bills for
the payment of the
money. It also appears
to have been
the subject of a
similar jest to that
respecting the tomb
of Duke Humphrey.
Robert Sempill, in his <cite>Banishment of Poverty</cite>, a poem referring to
the year 1680 or 1681, thus expresses himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent2">Even sweet Saint Giles and Earl of Murray.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the Earl of Murray’s tomb,
to the east, is the sepulchre of the Marquis of Montrose, executed
in 1650, and here interred most sumptuously, June 1661, after the
various parts of his body had been dispersed for eleven years in
different directions, according to his sentence.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PARLIAMENT_CLOSE" id="THE_PARLIAMENT_CLOSE">THE PARLIAMENT CLOSE.</a></h2>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Ancient Churchyard&mdash;Booths attached to the High Church&mdash;Goldsmiths&mdash;George
Heriot&mdash;The Deid-Chack.</strong></p>


<p>Previous to the seventeenth century, the ground now occupied
by the Parliament House, and the buildings adjacent to the
south and west, was the churchyard of St Giles’s, from the south
side of which edifice it extended down a steep declivity to the
Cowgate. This might formerly be considered the metropolitan
cemetery of Scotland; as, together with the internal space of the
church, it contained the ashes of many noble and remarkable
personages, John Knox amongst the number. After the Reformation,
when Queen Mary conferred the gardens of the Greyfriars
upon the town, the churchyard of St Giles’s ceased to be much
used as a burying-ground; and that extensive and more appropriate
place of sepulture succeeded to this in being made <em>the Westminster
Abbey of Scotland</em>.</p>

<p>The west side of the cemetery of St Giles’s was bounded by the
house of the provost of the church, who, in 1469, granted part of
the same to the citizens for the augmentation of the burying-ground.
From the charter accompanying the grant, it appears
that the provost’s house then also contained the public school of
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the churchyard<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> there was a small place of
worship denominated the <em>Chapel of Holyrood</em>. Walter Chapman,
the first printer in Edinburgh, in 1528 endowed an altar in this
chapel with his tenement in the Cowgate; and, by the tenor of
the charter, I am enabled to point out very nearly the residence
of this interesting person, who, besides being a printer, was a
respectable merchant in Edinburgh, and, it would appear, a very
pious man. The tenement is thus described: ‘All and haill this
tenement of land, back and foir, with houses, biggings, yards, and
well<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> thereof, lying in the Cowgate of Edinburgh, on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
side thereof, near the said chapel, betwixt the lands of James Lamb
on the east, and the lands of John Aber on the west, the arable
lands called Wairam’s Croft on the south, and the said street on
the north part.’</p>


<h3>BOOTHS.</h3>

<p>The precincts of St Giles’s being now secularised, the church
itself was, in 1628, degraded by numerous wooden booths being
stuck up around it. Yet, to show that
some reverence was still paid to the
sanctity of the place, the Town-council
decreed that no tradesmen should be
admitted to these shops except bookbinders,
mortmakers (watchmakers),
jewellers, and goldsmiths. <em>Bookbinders</em>
must here be meant to signify booksellers,
the latter term not being then
known in Scotland. Of
mortmakers there could
not be many, for watches
were imported from Germany
till about the conclusion
of the seventeenth
century. The goldsmiths
were a much more numerous
tribe than either of
their companions; for at
that time there prevailed
in Scotland, amongst the
aristocracy, a sort of rude
magnificence and taste for
show extremely favourable
to these tradesmen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300">
<img src="images/illus_p_110.jpg" width="300" height="349" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old St Giles’s.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1632, the present great hall of the Parliament House was
founded upon the site of the houses formerly occupied by the
ministers of St Giles’s. It was finished in 1639, at an expense of
£11,630 sterling, and devoted to the use of parliament.</p>

<p>It does not appear to have been till after the Restoration
that the Parliament Close was formed, by the erection of a line
of private buildings, forming a square with the church. These
houses, standing on a declivity, were higher on one side than the
other; one is said to have been fifteen stories altogether in height.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
All, however, were burned down in a great fire which happened
in 1700, after which buildings of twelve stories in height were
substituted.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Among the noble inhabitants of the Parliament Close at an
early period, the noble family of Wemyss were not the least
considerable. At the time of Porteous’s affair, when Francis, the
fifth earl, was a boy, his sisters persuaded him to act the part of
Captain Porteous in a sort of drama which they got up in imitation
of that strange scene. The foolish romps actually went the length
of tucking up their brother, the heir of the family, by the neck,
over a door; and their sports had well-nigh ended in a real tragedy,
for the helpless representative of Porteous was black in the face
before they saw the necessity of cutting him down.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The small booths around St Giles’s continued, till 1817, to
deform the outward appearance of the church. Long before their
destruction, the booksellers at least had found the space of six or
seven feet too small for the accommodation of their fast-increasing
wares, and removed to larger shops in the elegant tenements of the
square. One of the largest of the booths, adjacent to the south
side of the New or High Church, and having a second story, was
occupied, during a great part of the last century, by Messrs Kerr
and Dempster, goldsmiths. The first of these gentlemen had been
member of parliament for the city, and was the last citizen who
ever held that office [in the Scottish parliament]. Such was the
humility of people’s wishes in those days respecting their houses,
that this respectable person actually lived, and had a great number
of children, in the small space of the flat over the shop and the
cellar under it, which was lighted by a grating in the pavement of
the square. The subterraneous part of his house was chiefly devoted
to the purposes of a nursery, and proved so insalubrious that all
his children died successively at a particular age, with the exception
of his son Robert, who, being born much more weakly than
the rest, had the good luck to be sent to the country to be nursed,
and afterwards grew up to be the author of a work entitled <cite>The
Life of Robert Bruce</cite>, and the editor of a large collection of voyages
and travels.</p>


<h3>GOLDSMITHS.</h3>

<p>The goldsmiths of those days were considered a superior class of
tradesmen; they appeared in public with scarlet cloak, cocked hat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
and cane, as men of some consideration. Yet in their shops every
one of them would have been found working with his own hands
at some light labour, in a little recess near the window, generally
in a very plain dress, but ready to come forth at a moment’s notice
to serve a customer. Perhaps, down to 1780, there was not a
goldsmith in Edinburgh who did not condescend to manual labour.</p>

<p>As the whole trade was collected in the Parliament Close, this
was of course the place to which country couples resorted, during
the last century, in order to make the purchase of silver tea-spoons,
which always preceded their nuptials. It was then as customary
a thing in the country for the intending bridegroom to take a
journey, a few weeks before his marriage, to the Parliament Close,
in order to buy the <em>silver spoons</em>, as it was for the bride to have
all her clothes and stock of bed-furniture inspected by a committee
of matrons upon the wedding eve. And this important transaction
occasioned two journeys: one, in order to select the spoons, and
prescribe the initials which were to be marked upon them; the
other, to receive and pay for them. It must be understood that
the goldsmiths of Edinburgh then kept scarcely any goods on hand
in their shops, and that the smallest article had to be bespoken
from them some time before it was wanted. A goldsmith, who
entered as an apprentice about the beginning of the reign of
George III., informed me that they were beginning only at that
time to keep a few trifling articles on hand. Previously another
old custom had been abolished. It had been usual, upon both the
occasions above mentioned, for the goldsmith to adjourn with his
customer to John’s Coffee-house,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> or to the Baijen-hole,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and to
receive the order or the payment, in a comfortable manner, over a
dram and a <em>caup</em> of small ale; which were upon the first occasion
paid for by the customer, and upon the second by the trader;
and the goldsmith then was perhaps let into the whole secret
counsels of the rustic, including a history of his courtship&mdash;in
return for which he would take pains to amuse his customer with
a sketch of the city news. In time, as the views and capitals of
the Parliament Close goldsmiths became extended, all these pleasant
customs were abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<h3>GEORGE HERIOT.</h3>

<p>The shop and workshop of George Heriot existed in this
neighbourhood till 1809, when the extension of the Advocates’
Library occasioned the destruction of some interesting old <em>closes</em> to
the west of St Giles’s Kirk, and altered all the features of this part
of the town. There was a line of three small shops, with wooden
superstructures above them, extending between the door of the
Old Tolbooth and that of the <em>Laigh Council-house</em>, which occupied
the site of the present lobby of the Signet Library. A narrow
passage led between these shops and the west end of St Giles’s;
and George Heriot’s shop, being in the centre of the three, was
situated exactly opposite to the south window of the Little Kirk.
The back windows looked into an alley behind, called Beith’s or
Bess Wynd. In confirmation of this tradition, George Heriot’s
name was discovered upon the architrave of the door, being carved
in the stone, and apparently having served as his <em>sign</em>. Besides
this curious memorial, the booth was also found to contain his
forge and bellows, with a hollow stone, fitted with a stone cover or
lid, which had been used as a receptacle for and a means of extinguishing
the living embers of the furnace, upon closing the
shop at night. All these curiosities were bought by the late Mr
E. Robertson of the Commercial Bank, who had been educated in
Heriot’s Hospital, and by him presented to the governors, who
ordered them to be carefully deposited and preserved in the house,
where they now remain. George Heriot’s shop was only about
seven feet square! Yet his master, King James, is said to have
sometimes visited him and been treated by him here. There is a
story that one day, when the goldsmith visited His Majesty at
Holyrood, he found him sitting beside a fire, which, being composed
of perfumed wood, cast an agreeable smell through the room.
Upon George Heriot remarking its pleasantness, the king told him
that it was quite as costly as it was fine. Heriot said that if His
Majesty would come and pay him a visit at his shop, he would
show him a still more costly fire.</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ said the king; ‘and I will.’ He accordingly paid
the goldsmith a visit, but was surprised to find only an ordinary
fire. ‘Is this, then, your fine fire?’ said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Wait a little,’ said George, ‘till I get my fuel.’ So saying, he
took from his bureau a bond for two thousand pounds which
he had lent to the king, and laying it in the fire, added: ‘Now,
whether is your Majesty’s fire or mine most expensive?’</p>

<p>‘Yours most certainly, Master Heriot,’ said the king.</p>

<p>Adjacent to George Heriot’s shop, and contiguous to the
Laigh Council-house, there was a tavern, in which a great deal of
small legal business used to be transacted in bygone times. Peter
Williamson, an original and singular person, who had long been
in North America, and therefore designated himself ‘from the
other world,’ kept this house for many years.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It served also as
a sort of vestry to the Tolbooth Church, and was the place where
the magistrates took what was called the <em>Deid-chack</em>&mdash;that is, a
refreshment or dinner, of which those dignitaries always partook
after having attended an execution. The <em>Deid-chack</em> is now
abjured, like many other of those fashions which formerly rendered
the office of a magistrate so much more comfortable than it now is.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The various kirks which compose St Giles’s had all different
characters in former times. The High Kirk had a sort of dignified
aristocratic character, approaching somewhat to prelacy, and was
frequented only by sound church-and-state men, who did not care
so much for the sermon as for the gratification of sitting in the
same place with His Majesty’s Lords of Council and Session and
the magistrates of Edinburgh, and who desired to be thought men
of sufficient liberality and taste to appreciate the prelections of
Blair. The Old Kirk, in the centre of the whole, was frequented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
by people who wished to have a sermon of good divinity, about
three-quarters of an hour long, and who did not care for the
darkness and dreariness of their temple. The Tolbooth Kirk was
the peculiar resort of a set of rigid Calvinists from the Lawnmarket
and the head of the Bow, termed the <em>Towbuith-Whigs</em>,
who loved nothing but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i> evangelical sermons, and would
have considered it sufficient to bring the house down about their
ears if the precentor had ceased, for one verse, the old hillside
fashion of reciting the lines of the psalm before singing them. Dr
Webster, of convivial memory, was long one of the clergymen of
this church, and deservedly admired as a pulpit orator; though
his social habits often ran nigh to scandalise his devout and self-denying
congregation.</p>

<p>The inhabitants and shopkeepers of the Parliament Square were
in former times very sociable and friendly as neighbours, and
formed themselves into a sort of society, which was long known by
the name of <em>The Parliament-Close Council</em>. Of this association
there were from fifty to a hundred members, who met once or
twice a year at a dinner, when they usually spent the evening, as
the newspaper phrase goes, ‘in the utmost harmony.’ The whim
of this club consisted in each person assuming a titular dignity at
the dinner, and being so called all the year after by his fellow-members.
One was Lord Provost of Edinburgh, another was
Dean of Guild, some were bailies, others deacons, and a great
proportion state-officers. Sir William Forbes, who, with the
kindness of heart which characterised him, condescended to hold a
place in this assemblage of mummers, was for a long time <em>Member
for the City</em>.</p>

<p>Previous to the institution of the police-court, a bailie of
Edinburgh used to sit, every Monday, at that part of the Outer
Parliament House where the statue of Lord Melville now stands,
to hear and decide upon small causes&mdash;such as prosecutions for
scandals and defamation, or cases of quarrels among the vulgar and
the infamous. This judicature, commonly called the <em>Dirt Court</em>,
was chiefly resorted to by washerwomen from Canonmills and the
drunken ale-wives of the Canongate. A list of Dirt-Court
processes used always to be hung up on a board every Monday
morning at one of the pillars in the piazza at the outside of the
Parliament Square; and that part of the piazza, being the lounge
of two or three low pettifoggers who managed such pleas, was
popularly called the <em>Scoundrels’ Walk</em>. Early on Monday, it was
usual to see one or two threadbare personages, with prodigiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
clean linen, bustling about with an air of importance, and
occasionally accosted by viragoes with long-eared caps flying behind
their heads. These were the agents of the Dirt Court, undergoing
conference with their clients.</p>

<p>There was something lofty and august about the Parliament
Close, which we shall scarcely ever see revived in any modern part
of the town; so dark and majestic were the buildings all round,
and so finely did the whole harmonise with the ancient cathedral
which formed one of its sides! Even the echoes of the Parliament
Square had something grand in them. Such, perhaps, were the
feelings of William Julius Mickle when he wrote a poem on
passing through the Parliament Close of Edinburgh at midnight,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
of which the following is one of the best passages:</p>

<p>He who now sees the wide hollow space between the Old and
New Towns, occupied by beautiful gardens, having their
continuity only somewhat curiously broken up by a transverse
earthen mound and a line of railway, must be at a loss to realise
the idea of the same space presenting in former times a lake,
which was regarded as a portion of the physical defences of the
city. Yet many, in common with myself, must remember the by
no means distant time when the remains of this sheet of water,
consisting of a few pools, served as excellent sliding and skating
ground in winter, while their neglected grass-green precincts too
frequently formed an arena whereon the high and mighty quarrels
of Old and New Town <em>cowlies</em><a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> [etymology of the word unknown]
were brought to a lapidarian arbitration.</p>

<p>The lake, it after all appears, was artificial, being fed by springs
under the Castle Rock, and retained by a dam at the foot of
Halkerston’s Wynd;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> which dam was a passable way from the city
to the fields on the north. Bower, the continuator of Fordun,
speaks of a tournament held on the ground, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi nunc est lacus</i>, in
1396, by order of the queen [of Robert III.], at which her eldest
son, Prince David, then in his twentieth year, presided. At the
beginning of the sixteenth century a ford upon the North Loch
is mentioned. Archbishop Beatoun escaped across that ford in
1517, when flying from the unlucky street-skirmish called <em>Cleanse
the Causeway</em>. In those early times the town corporation kept
ducks and swans upon the loch for ornament’s sake, and various
acts occur in their register for preserving those birds. An act,
passed in council between the years 1589 and 1594, ordained ‘a
boll of oats to be bought for feeding the swans in the North
Loch;’ and a person was unlawed at the same time for shooting
a swan in the said loch, and obliged to find another in its place.
The lake seems to have been a favourite scene for boating. Various
houses in the neighbourhood had servitudes of the use of a boat
upon it; and these, in later times, used to be employed to no little
purpose in smuggling whisky into the town.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span></p>
<p>The North Loch was the place in which our pious ancestors
used to dip and drown offenders against morality, especially of
the female sex. The Reformers, therefore, conceived that they
had not only done a very proper, but also a very witty thing,
when they threw into this lake, in 1558, the statue of St Giles,
which formerly adorned their High Church, and which they had
contrived to abstract.</p>

<p>It was also the frequent scene of suicide, and on this point one
or two droll anecdotes are related. A man was deliberately proceeding
to drown himself in the North Loch, when a crowd of the
townspeople rushed down to the water-side, venting cries of horror
and alarm at the spectacle, yet without actually venturing into
the water to prevent him from accomplishing the rash act. Hearing
the tumult, the father of the late Lord Henderland threw up
his window in James’s Court, and leaning out, cried down the brae
to the people: ‘What’s all the noise about? Can’t ye e’en let
the honest man gang to the de’il his ain gate?’ Whereupon the
honest man quietly walked out of the loch, to the no small amusement
of his lately appalled neighbours. It is also said that a
poor woman, having resolved to put an end to her existence,
waded a considerable way into the water, designing to take the
fatal plunge when she should reach a place where the lake was
sufficiently deep. Before she could satisfy herself on that point,
her hoop caught the water, and lifted her off her feet. At the
same time the wind caught her figure, and blew her, whether she
would or not, into the centre of the pool, as if she had been
sailing upon an inverted tub. She now became <em>alarmed</em>, screamed
for help, and waved her arms distractedly; all of which signs
brought a crowd to the shore she had just left, who were unable,
however, to render her any assistance, before she had landed on
the other side&mdash;fairly cured, it appeared, of all desire of quitting
the uneasy coil of mortal life.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PARLIAMENT_HOUSE" id="THE_PARLIAMENT_HOUSE">THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE.</a></h2>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Old Arrangements of the House&mdash;Justice in Bygone Times&mdash;Court
of Session Garland&mdash;Parliament House Worthies.</strong></p>


<p>The Parliament House, a spacious hall with an oaken arched
roof, finished in 1639 for the meetings of the Estates or
native parliament, and used for that purpose till the Union,
has since then, as is well known, served exclusively as a material
portion of the suite of buildings required for the supreme civil
judicatory&mdash;the Court of Session. This hall, usually styled the
<em>Outer House</em>, is now a nearly empty space, but it was in a very
different state within the recollection of aged practitioners. So
lately as 1779, it retained the divisions, furnishings, and other
features which it had borne in the days when we had a national
legislature&mdash;excepting only that the portraits of sovereigns which
then adorned the walls had been removed by the Earl of Mar, to
whom Queen Anne had given them as a present when the Union
was accomplished.</p>

<p>The divisions and furniture, it may be remarked, were understood
to be precisely those which had been used for the Court
of Session from an early time; but it appears that such changes
were made when the parliament was to sit as left the room one
free vacant space. The southern portion, separated from the rest
by a screen, accommodated the Court of Session. The northern
portion, comprising a sub-section used for the Sheriff-court, was
chiefly a kind of lobby of irregular form, surrounded by little
booths, which were occupied as taverns, booksellers’ shops, and
toy-shops, all of very flimsy materials.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> These <em>krames</em>, or boxes,
seem to have been established at an early period, the idea being
no doubt taken from the former condition of Westminster Hall.
John Spottiswoode of Spottiswoode, who, in 1718, published the
<cite>Forms of Process before the Court of Session</cite>, mentions that there
were ‘two keepers of the session-house, who had small salaries to
do all the menial offices in the house, and that no small part of
their annual perquisites came from the <em>kramers</em> in the outer hall.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span></p>

<h3>JUSTICE IN BYGONE TIMES.</h3>

<p>The memories which have been preserved of the administration
of justice by the Court of Session in its earlier days are not such
as to increase our love for past times.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> This court is described
by Buchanan as extremely arbitrary, and by a nearly contemporary
historian (Johnston) as infamous for its dishonesty. An advocate
or barrister is spoken of by the latter writer as taking money from
his clients, and dividing it among the judges for their votes. At
this time we find the chancellor (Lord Fyvie) superintending the
lawsuits of a friend, and writing to him the way and manner in
which he proposed they should be conducted. But the strongest
evidence of the corruption of ‘the lords’ is afforded by an act of
1579, prohibiting them ‘be thame selffis or be their wiffis or
servandes, to tak in ony time cuming, <em>buddis</em>, <em>bribes</em>, <em>gudes</em>, <em>or
geir</em>, fra quhatever persone or persons presentlie havand, or that
heirefter sall happyne to have, <em>any actionis or caussis pursewit
befoir thame</em>, aither fra the persewer or defender,’ under pain of
confiscation. Had not bribery been common amongst the judges,
such an act as this could never have been passed.</p>

<p>In the curious history of the family of Somerville there is a
very remarkable anecdote illustrative of the course of justice at
that period. Lord Somerville and his kinsman, Somerville of
Cambusnethan, had long carried on a litigation. The former was
at length advised to use certain means for the advancement of his
cause with the Regent Morton, it being then customary for the
sovereign to preside in the court. Accordingly, having one evening
caused his agents to prepare all the required papers, he went
next morning to the palace, and being admitted to the regent,
informed him of the cause, and entreated him to order it to be
called that forenoon. He then took out his purse, as if to give
a few pieces to the pages or servants, and slipping it down upon
the table, hurriedly left the presence-chamber. The earl cried
several times after him: ‘My lord, you have left your purse;’
but he had no wish to stop. At length, when he was at the
outer porch, a servant overtook him with a request that he would
go back to breakfast with the regent. He did so, was kindly
treated, and soon after was taken by Morton in his coach to the
court-room in the city. ‘Cambusnethan, by accident, as the coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
passed, was standing at Niddry’s Wynd head, and having inquired
who was in it with the regent, he was answered: “None but Lord
Somerville and Lord Boyd;” upon which he struck his breast, and
said: “This day my cause is lost!” and indeed it proved so.’ By
twelve o’clock that day, Lord Somerville had gained a cause which
had been hanging in suspense for years.</p>

<p>In those days both civil and criminal procedure was conducted
in much the same spirit as a suit at war. When a great noble
was to be tried for some monstrous murder or treason, he appeared
at the bar with as many of his retainers, and as many of his
friends and their retainers, as he could muster, and justice only
had its course if the government chanced to be the strongest,
which often was not the case. It was considered dishonourable
not to countenance a friend in troubles of this kind, however black
might be his moral guilt. The trial of Bothwell for the assassination
of Darnley is a noted example of a criminal outbraving his
judges and jury. Relationship, friendly connection, solicitation
of friends, and direct bribes were admitted and recognised influences
to which the civil judge was expected to give way. If a
difficulty were found in inducing a judge to vote against his
conscience, he might at least perhaps be induced by some of those
considerations to absent himself, so as to allow the case to go in
the desired way. The story of the abduction of Gibson of Durie
by Christie’s Will, and his immurement in a Border tower for
some weeks, that his voice might be absent in the decision of a
case&mdash;as given in the <cite>Border Minstrelsy</cite> by Scott&mdash;is only incorrect
in some particulars. (As the real case is reported in Pitcairn’s
<cite>Criminal Trials</cite>, it appears that, in September 1601, Gibson was
carried off from the neighbourhood of St Andrews by George
Meldrum, younger of Dumbreck, and hastily transported to the
castle of Harbottle in Northumberland, and kept there for eight
days.) But, after all, Scotland was not singular among European
nations in these respects. In Molière’s <cite>Misanthrope</cite>, produced in
1666, we find the good-natured Philinte coolly remonstrating with
Alceste on his unreasonable resolution to let his lawsuit depend
only on right and equity.</p>

<p>‘Qui voulez-vous donc, qui pour vous sollicite?’ says Philinte.
‘Aucun juge par vous ne sera visité?’</p>

<p>‘Je ne remuerai point,’ returns the misanthrope.</p>

<p><em>Philinte.</em> Votre partie est forte, et peut par sa cabale entrainer....</p>

<p><em>Alceste.</em> Il n’importe....</p>

<p><em>Philinte.</em> Quel homme!... On se riroit de vous, Alceste, si on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
vous entendoit parler de la façon. (<em>People would laugh at you if
they heard you talk in this manner.</em>)</p>

<p>It is a general tradition in Scotland that the English judges
whom Cromwell sent down to administer the law in Scotland,
for the first time made the people acquainted with impartiality
of judgment. It is added that, after the Restoration, when
native lords were again put upon the bench, some one, in presence
of the President Gilmour, lauding the late English judges for the
equity of their proceedings, his lordship angrily remarked: ‘De’il
thank them; a wheen kinless loons!’ That is, no thanks to
them; a set of fellows without relations in the country, and who,
consequently, had no one to please by their decisions.</p>

<p>After the Restoration there was no longer direct bribing, but
other abuses still flourished. The judges were tampered with by
private solicitation. Decisions went in favour of the man of most
personal or family influence. The following anecdote of the reign
of Charles II. rests on excellent authority: ‘A Scotch gentleman
having entreated the Earl of Rochester to speak to the Duke of
Lauderdale upon the account of a business that seemed to be
supported by a clear and undoubted right, his lordship very
obligingly promised to do his utmost endeavours to engage the
duke to stand his friend in a concern so just and reasonable as
his was; and accordingly, having conferred with his grace about
the matter, the duke made him this very odd return, that though
he questioned not the right of the gentleman he recommended to
him, yet he could not promise him a helping hand, and far less
success in business, if he knew not first the man, whom perhaps
his lordship had some reason to conceal; “because,” said he to
the earl, “if your lordship were as well acquainted with the
customs of Scotland as I am, you had undoubtedly known this
among others&mdash;<em>Show me the man, and I’ll show you the law</em>;” giving
him to understand that the law in Scotland could protect no man
if either his purse were empty or his adversaries great men, or
supported by great ones.’<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>One peculiar means of favouring a particular party was then
in the power of the presiding judge: he could call a cause when
he pleased. Thus he would watch till one or more judges who
took the opposite view to his own were out of the way&mdash;either
in attendance on other duties or from illness&mdash;and then calling
the cause, would decide it according to his predilection. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
the first President Dalrymple, afterwards Viscount Stair, one of
the most eminent men whom the Scottish law-courts have ever
produced, condescended to favour a party in this way. An act
enjoining the calling of causes according to their place in a
regular roll was passed in the reign of Charles II.; but the
practice was not enforced till the days of President Forbes, sixty
years later. We have a remarkable illustration of the partiality
of the bench in a circumstance which took place about the time
of the Revolution. During the pleadings in a case between
Mr Pitilloch, an advocate, and Mr Aytoun of Inchdairnie, the
former applied the term <em>briber</em> to Lord Harcarse, a judge seated
at the moment on the bench, and who was father-in-law to the
opposite party. The man was imprisoned for contempt; but this
is not the point. Not long after, in this same cause, Lord
Harcarse went down to the bar in his gown, and pleaded for his
son-in-law Aytoun!</p>

<p>About that period a curious indirect means of influencing the
judges began to be notorious. Each lord had a dependant or
favourite, generally some young relative, practising in the court,
through whom it was understood that he could be prepossessed
with a favourable view of any cause. This functionary was called
a <em>Peat</em> or <em>Pate</em>, from a circumstance thus related in Wilkes’s <cite>North
Briton</cite>: ‘One of the former judges of the Court of Session, of
the first character, knowledge, and application to business, had a
son at the bar whose name was Patrick; and when the suitors
came about, soliciting his favour, his question was: “Have you
consulted <em>Pat</em>?” If the answer was affirmative, the usual reply
of his lordship was: “I’ll inquire of <em>Pat</em> about it; I’ll take care
of your cause; go home and mind your business.” The judge in
that case was even as good as his word, for while his brother-judges
were robing, he would tell them what pains his son had
taken, and what trouble he had put himself to, by his directions,
in order to find out the real circumstances of the dispute;
and as no one on the bench would be so unmannerly as to question
the veracity of the son or the judgment of the father, the decree
always went according to the information of <em>Pat</em>. At the present
era, in case a judge has no son at the bar, his nearest relation
(and he is sure to have one there) officiates in that station.
But, as it frequently happens, if there are <em>Pats</em> employed on each
side, the judges differ, and the greatest interest&mdash;that is, the
longest purse&mdash;is sure to carry it.’</p>

<p>I bring the subject to a conclusion by a quotation from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
<cite>Court of Session Garland</cite>: ‘Even so far down as 1737 traces of
the ancient evil may be found. Thus, in some very curious letters
which passed between William Foulis, Esq. of Woodhall, and his
agent, Thomas Gibson of Durie, there is evidence that private
influence could even then be resorted to. The agent writes to his
client, in reference to a pending lawsuit (23rd November 1735):
“I have spoken to Strachan and several of the lords, who are all
surprised Sir F[rancis Kinloch] should stand that plea. By Lord
St Clair’s advice, Mrs Kinloch is to wait on Lady Cairnie to-morrow,
to cause her ask the favour of Lady St Clair to solicit Lady Betty
Elphingston and Lady Dun. My lord promises to back his lady,
and to ply both their lords, also Leven and his cousin Murkle.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
He is your good friend, and wishes success; he is jealous Mrs
Mackie will side with her cousin Beatie. St Clair says <em>Leven<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> has
only once gone wrong upon his hand since he was a Lord of Session</em>.
Mrs Kinloch has been with Miss Pringle, Newhall. Young Dr
Pringle is <em>a good agent there</em>, and discourses Lord Newhall<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
<em>strongly on the law of nature</em>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘Again, upon the 23rd of January 1737, he writes: “I can
assure you that when Lord Primrose left this town, he stayed all
that day with Lord J[ustice] C[lerk],<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and went to Andrew
Broomfield at night, and went off post next morning; and what
made him despair of getting anything done was, that it has been
so long delayed, after promising so frankly, when he knew the one
could cause the other trot to him like a penny-dog when he
pleased. But there’s another hindrance: I suspect much Penty<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
has not been in town as yet, and I fancy it’s by him the other
must be managed. The Ld. J[ustice] C[lerk] is frank enough, but
the other two are &mdash;&mdash; clippies. I met with Bavelaw and Mr
William on Tuesday last. I could not persuade the last to go to
a wine-house, so away we went to an aquavity-house, where I told
Mr Wm. what had passed, as I had done before that to Bavelaw.
They seemed to agree nothing could be done just now, but to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
why Lord Drummore<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> dissuaded bringing in the plea last winter.
<em>I have desired Lord Haining to speak</em>, but only expect his answer
against Tuesday or Wednesday.”</p>

<p>‘It is not our intention to pursue these remarks further, although
we believe that judicial corruption continued long after the Union.
We might adduce Lord President Forbes as a witness on this point,
who, one of the most upright lawyers himself, did not take any
pains to conceal his contempt for many of his brethren. A
favourite toast of his is said to have been: “Here’s to such of the
judges as don’t deserve the gallows.” Latterly, the complaint
against the judges was not so much for corrupt dealing, with the
view of enriching themselves or their “pet” lawyer, but for weak
prejudices and feelings, which but ill accorded with the high office
they filled.</p>

<p>‘These abuses, the recapitulation of which may amuse and
instruct, are now only matter of history&mdash;the spots that once
sullied the garments of justice are effaced, and the old compend,
“Show me the man, and I’ll show you the law,” is out of date.’</p>


<h3>COURT OF SESSION GARLAND.</h3>

<p>A curious characteristic view of the Scottish bench about the
year 1771 is presented in a doggerel ballad, supposed to have been
a joint composition of James Boswell and John Maclaurin,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
advocates, and professedly the history of a process regarding a bill
containing a clause of penalty in case of failure. This <cite>Court of

<h3>LOCKHART OF COVINGTON.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></h3>

<p>Lockhart used to be spoken of by all old men about the Court
of Session as a paragon. He had been at the bar from 1722, and
had attained the highest eminence long before going upon the
bench, which he did at an unusually late period of life; yet so
different were those times from the present that, according to the
report of Sir William Macleod Bannatyne to myself in 1833,
Lockhart realised only about a thousand a year by his exertions,
then thought a magnificent income. The first man at the Scottish
bar in our day is believed to gain at least six times this sum
annually. Lockhart had an isolated house behind the Parliament
Close, which was afterwards used as the Post-office.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It was
removed some years ago to make way for the extension of the
buildings connected with the court; leaving only its coach-house
surviving, now occupied as a broker’s shop in the Cowgate.</p>

<p>Mr Lockhart and Mr Fergusson (afterwards Lord Pitfour) were
rival barristers&mdash;agreeing, however, in their politics, which were of
a Jacobite complexion. While the trials of the poor <em>forty-five</em>
men were going on at Carlisle, these Scottish lawyers heard with
indignation of the unscrupulous measures adopted to procure convictions.
They immediately set off for Carlisle, arranging with
each other that Lockhart should examine evidence, while Fergusson
pleaded and addressed the jury; and offering their services, they
were gladly accepted as counsel by the unfortunates whose trials
were yet to take place. Each exerted his abilities, in his respective
duties, with the greatest solicitude, but with very little effect.
The jurors of Carlisle had been so frightened by the Highland
army that they thought everything in the shape or hue of tartan
a damning proof of guilt; and, in truth, there seemed to be no
discrimination whatever exerted in inquiring into the merits of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
particular criminal; and it might have been just as fair, and much
more convenient, to try them by wholesale or in companies. At
length one of our barristers fell upon an ingenious expedient, which
had a better effect than all the eloquence he had expended. He
directed his man-servant to dress himself in some tartan habiliments,
to skulk about for a short time in the neighbourhood of the town,
and then permit himself to be taken. The man did so, and was
soon brought into court, and accused of the crime of high treason,
and would have been condemned to death had not his master
stood up, claimed him as his servant, and proved beyond dispute
that the supposed criminal had been in immediate attendance upon
his person during the whole time of the Rebellion. This staggered
the jury, and, with the aid of a little amplification from the mouth
of the young advocate, served to make them more cautious afterwards
in the delivery of their important fiat.</p>

<p>To show the estimation in which Lockhart of Covington was
held as an advocate, the late Lord Newton, when at the bar, wore
his gown till it was in tatters, and at last had a new one made,
with a fragment of the neck of the original sewed into it, whereby
he could still make it his boast that he wore ‘Covington’s gown.’</p>


<h3>LORD KAMES.</h3>

<p>This able judge and philosopher in advance of his time&mdash;for
such he was&mdash;is described by his biographer, Lord Woodhouselee,
as indulging in a certain humorous playfulness, which, to those
who knew him intimately, detracted nothing from the feeling of
respect due to his eminent talents and virtues. To strangers, his
lordship admits, it might convey ‘the idea of lightness.’ The
simple fact here shadowed forth is that Lord Kames had a roughly
playful manner, and used phrases of an ultra-eccentric character.
Among these was a word only legitimately applicable to the female
of the canine species. The writer of the <cite>Garland</cite> introduces this
characteristic phrase. When his lordship found his end approaching
very near, he took a public farewell of his brethren. I was informed
by an ear-and-eye witness, who is certain that he could not
be mistaken, that, after addressing them in a solemn speech and
shaking their hands all round, in going out at the door of the court-room
he turned about, and casting them a last look, cried in his
usual familiar tone: ‘Fare ye a’ weel, ye bitches!’ He died eight
days after.</p>

<p>It was remarked that a person called <em>Sinkum the Cawdy</em>, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
had a short and a long leg and was excessively addicted to swearing,
used to lie in wait for Lord Kames almost every morning, and walk
alongside of him up the street to the Parliament House. The
mystery of Sterne’s little, flattering Frenchman, who begged so
successfully from the ladies, was scarcely more wonderful than this
intimacy, which arose entirely from Lord Kames’s love of the
gossip which Sinkum made it his business to cater for him.</p>

<p>These are not follies of the wise. They are only the tribute
which great genius pays to simple nature. The serenity which
marked the close of the existence of Kames was most creditable to
him, though it appeared, perhaps, in somewhat whimsical forms to
his immediate friends. For three or four days before his death, he
was in a state of great debility. Some one coming in, and finding
him, notwithstanding his weakness, engaged in dictating to an
amanuensis, expressed surprise. ‘How, man,’ said the declining
philosopher, ‘would you ha’e me stay wi’ my tongue in my cheek
till death comes to fetch me?’</p>


<h3>LORD HAILES.</h3>

<p>When Lord Hailes died, it was a long time before any will could
be found. The heir-male was about to take possession of his
estates, to the exclusion of his eldest daughter. Some months
after his lordship’s death, when it was thought that all further
search was vain, Miss Dalrymple prepared to retire from New
Hailes, and also from the mansion-house in New Street, having lost
all hope of a will being discovered in her favour. Some of her
domestics, however, were sent to lock up the house in New Street,
and in closing the window-shutters, Lord Hailes’s will dropped out
upon the floor from behind a panel, and was found to secure her in
the possession of his estates, which she enjoyed for upwards of
forty years.</p>

<p>The literary habits of Lord Hailes were hardly those which
would have been expected from his extreme nicety of phrase. The
late Miss Dalrymple once did me the honour to show me the place
where he wrote the most of his works&mdash;not the fine room which
contained, and still contains, his books&mdash;no secluded boudoir, or
den, where he could shut out the world, but the parlour fireside,
where sat his wife and children.</p>

<p>[1868.&mdash;Now that the grave has for thirty years closed over Miss
Dalrymple, it may be allowable to tell that she was of dwarfish and
deformed figure, while amiable and judicious above the average of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
her sex. Taking into view her beautiful place of residence and her
large wealth, she remarked to a friend one day: ‘I can say, for the
honour of man, that I never got an offer in my life.’]</p>


<h3>LORD GARDENSTONE.</h3>

<p>This judge had a predilection for pigs. One, in its juvenile
years, took a particular fancy for his lordship, and followed him
wherever he went, like a dog, reposing in the same bed. When it
attained the mature years and size of swinehood, this of course was
inconvenient. However, his lordship, unwilling to part with his
friend, continued to let it sleep at least in the same room, and,
when he undressed, laid his clothes upon the floor as a bed to it.
He said that he liked it, for it kept his clothes warm till the
morning. In his mode of living he was full of strange, eccentric
fancies, which he seemed to adopt chiefly with a view to his health,
which was always that of a valetudinarian.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>


<h3>LORD PRESIDENT DUNDAS.</h3>

<p>This distinguished judge was, in his latter years, extremely subject
to gout, and used to fall backwards and forwards in his chair&mdash;whence
the ungracious expression in the <cite>Garland</cite>. He used to
characterise his six clerks thus: ‘Two of them cannot <em>read</em>, two
of them cannot <em>write</em>, and the other two can neither <em>read</em> nor
<em>write</em>!’ The eccentric Sir James Colquhoun was one of those who
could not <em>read</em>. In former times it was the practice of the Lord
President to have a sand-glass before him on the bench, with which
he used to measure out the utmost time that could be allowed to
a judge for the delivery of his opinion. Lord President Dundas
would never allow a single moment after the expiration of the sand,
and he has often been seen to shake his old-fashioned chronometer
ominously in the faces of his brethren when their ‘ideas upon the
subject’ began, in the words of the <cite>Garland</cite>, to get vague and
windy.</p>


<h3>LORD MONBODDO.</h3>

<p>Lord Monboddo’s motion for the enforcement of the bill, on
account of its representing the value of a horse, is partly an allusion
to his Gulliverlike admiration of that animal, but more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
to his having once embroiled himself in an action respecting a
horse which belonged to himself. His lordship had committed the
animal, when sick, to the charge of a farrier, with directions for the
administration of a certain medicine. The farrier gave the medicine,
but went beyond his commission, in as far as he mixed it in a
liberal <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">menstruum</i> of treacle in order to make it palatable. The
horse dying next morning, Lord Monboddo raised a prosecution
for its value, and actually pleaded his own cause at the bar. He
lost the case, however; and is said to have been so enraged in consequence
at his brethren that he never afterwards sat with them
upon the bench, but underneath amongst the clerks. The report
of this action is exceedingly amusing, on account of the great
quantity of Roman law quoted by the judges, and the strange
circumstances under which the case appeared before them.</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo, with all his oddities, and though generally
hated or despised by his brethren, was by far the most learned and
not the least upright judge of his time. His attainments in
classical learning and in the study of the ancient philosophers
were singular in his time in Scotland, and might have qualified him
to shine anywhere. He was the earliest patron of one of the best
scholars of his age, the late Professor John Hunter of St Andrews,
who was for many years his secretary, and who chiefly wrote the
first and best volume of his lordship’s <cite>Treatise on the Origin of
Languages</cite>.</p>

<p>The manners of Lord Monboddo were not more odd than his
personal appearance. He looked rather like an old stuffed monkey
dressed in a judge’s robes than anything else. His face, however,
‘sicklied o’er’ with the pale cast of thought, bore traces of high
intellect. So convinced is he said to have been of the truth of his
fantastic theory of human tails, that whenever a child happened to
be born in his house, he would watch at the chamber-door in
order to see it in its first state, having a notion that the midwives
pinched off the infant tails.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that Lord Monboddo attended and witnessed
the catastrophe of Captain Porteous in 1736. He had just that
day returned from completing his law education at Leyden, and
taken lodgings near the foot of the West Bow, where at that time
many of the greatest lawyers resided. When the rioters came
down the Bow with their hapless victim, Mr Burnet was roused
from bed by the noise, came down in his night-gown with a candle
in his hand, and stood in a sort of stupor, looking on, till the
tragedy was concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span></p>


<h3>PARLIAMENT HOUSE WORTHIES.</h3>

<p>Scott has sketched in <cite>Peter Peebles</cite> the type of a class of crazy
and half-crazy litigants who at all times haunt the Parliament
House. Usually they are rustic men possessing small properties,
such as a house and garden, which they are constantly talking
of as their ‘subject.’ Sometimes a faded shawl and bonnet is
associated with the case&mdash;objects to be dreaded by every good-natured
member of the bar. But most frequently it is simple
countrymen who become pests of this kind. That is to say, simple
men of difficult and captious tempers, cursed with an overstrong
sense of right or an overstrong sense of wrong, under which they
would, by many degrees, prefer utter ruin to making the slightest
concession to a neighbour. Ruined these men often are; and yet
it seems ruin well bought, since they have all along had the pleasure
of seeing themselves and their little affairs the subject of consideration
amongst men so much above themselves in rank.</p>

<p>Peebles was, as we are assured by the novelist himself, a real
person, who frequented the Edinburgh courts of justice about
the year 1792, and ‘whose voluminous course of litigation served
as a sort of essay piece to most young men who were called to
the bar.’<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Many persons recollect him as a tall, thin, slouching
man, of homely outworn attire, understood to be a native of
Linlithgow. Having got into law about a small house, he became
deranged by the cause going against him, and then peace was no
more for him on earth. He used to tell his friends that he had
at present thirteen causes in hand, but was only going to ‘move
in’ seven of them this session. When anxious for a consultation
on any of his affairs, he would set out from his native burgh at
the time when other people were going to bed, and reaching
Edinburgh at four in the morning, would go about the town
ringing the bells of the principal advocates, in the vain hope of
getting one to rise and listen to him, to the infinite annoyance
of many a poor serving-girl, and no less of the Town-guard, into
whose hands he generally fell.</p>

<p>Another specimen of the class was Campbell of Laguine, who
had perhaps been longer at law than any man of modern times.
He was a store-farmer in Caithness, and had immense tracts of
land under lease. When he sold his wool, he put the price in
his pocket (no petty sum), and came down to waste it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
Court of Session. His custom&mdash;an amusing example of method
in madness&mdash;was to pay every meal which he made at the inns
on the road <em>double</em>, that he might have a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</i> meal on his
return, knowing he would not bring a cross away in his pocket
from the courts of justice. Laguine’s figure was very extraordinary.
His legs were like two circumflexes, both curving
outward in the same direction; so that, relative to his body, they
took the direction of the blade of a reaping-hook, supposing the
trunk of his person to be the handle. These extraordinary legs
were always attired in Highland trews, as his body was generally
in a gray or tartan jacket, with a bonnet on his head; and duly
appeared he at the door of the Parliament House, bearing a
tin case, fully as big as himself, containing a plan of his farms.
He paid his lawyers highly, but took up a great deal of their
time. One gentleman, afterwards high in official situation,
observed him coming up to ring his bell, and not wishing that
he himself should throw away his time or Laguine his fee,
directed that he should be denied. Laguine, however, made his
way to the lady of the learned counsel, and sitting down in the
drawing-room, went at great length into the merits of his cause,
and exhibited his plans; and when he had expatiated for a couple
of hours, he departed, but not without leaving a handsome fee,
observing that he had as much satisfaction as if he had seen the
learned counsel himself. He once told a legal friend of the writer
that his laird and he were nearly agreed now&mdash;there was only
about <em>ten miles of country</em> contested betwixt them! When finally
this great cause was adjusted, his agent said: ‘Well, Laguine,
what will ye do now?’ rashly judging that one who had, in a
manner, lived upon law for a series of years would be at a loss
how to dispose of himself now. ‘No difficulty there,’ answered
Laguine; ‘I’ll dispute your account, and go to law with <em>you</em>!’
Possessed as he was by a demon of litigation, Campbell is said to
have been, apart from his disputes, a shrewd and sensible, and,
moreover, an honourable and worthy man. He was one of the
first who introduced sheep-farming into Ross-shire and Caithness,
where he had farms as large as some whole Lowland or English
counties; and but for litigation, he had the opportunity of
making much money.</p>

<p>A person usually called, from his trade, the Heckler was
another Parliament House worthy. He used to work the whole
night at his trade; then put on a black suit, curled his hair
behind and powdered it, so as to resemble a clergyman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
came forth to attend to the great business of the day at the
Parliament House. He imagined that he was deputed by Divine
Providence as a sort of controller of the Court of Session; but
as if that had not been sufficient, he thought the charge of the
General Assembly was also committed to him; and he used to
complain that that venerable body was ‘much worse to keep in
good order’ than the lawyers. He was a little, smart, well-brushed,
neat-looking man, and used to talk to himself, smile, and nod with
much vivacity. Part of his lunacy was to believe himself a clergyman;
and it was chiefly the Teind Court which he haunted, his
object there being to obtain an augmentation of his stipend. The
appearance and conversation of the man were so plausible that he
once succeeded in imposing himself upon Dr Blair as a preacher,
and obtained permission to hold forth in the High Church on the
ensuing Sunday. He was fortunately recognised when about to
mount the pulpit. Some idle boys about the Parliament House,
where he was a constant attendant, persuaded him that, as he held
two such dignified offices as his imagination shaped out, there
must be some salary attached to them, payable, like others upon
the Establishment, in the Exchequer. This very nearly brought
about a serious catastrophe; for the poor madman, finding his
applications slighted at the Exchequer, came there one day with a
pistol heavily loaded to shoot Mr Baird, a very worthy man, an
officer of that court. This occasioned the Heckler being confined
in durance vile for a long time; though, I think, he was at length
emancipated.</p>

<p>Other insane fishers in the troubled waters of the law were the
following:</p>

<p>Macduff of Ballenloan, who had two cases before the court
at once. His success in the one depended upon his showing
that he had capacity to manage his own affairs; and in the
other, upon his proving himself incapable of doing so. He
used to complain, with some apparent reason, that he lost them
both!</p>

<p>Andrew Nicol, who was at law thirty years about a <em>midden-stead</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anglicé</i>,
the situation of a dunghill. This person was a
native of Kinross, a sensible-looking countryman, with a large,
flat, blue bonnet, in which guise Kay has a very good portrait of
him, displaying, with chuckling pride, a plan of his precious
midden-stead. He used to frequent the Register House as well
as the courts of law, and was encouraged in his foolish pursuits
by the roguish clerks of that establishment, by whom he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
denominated <em>Muck Andrew</em>, in allusion to the object of his
litigation. This wretched being, after losing property and credit
and his own senses in following a valueless phantom, died at last
(1817) in Cupar jail, where he was placed by one of his legal
creditors.</p>

<p>Tavern dissipation, now so rare amongst the respectable classes
of the community, formerly prevailed in Edinburgh to an
incredible extent, and engrossed the leisure hours of all professional
men, scarcely excepting even the most stern and dignified. No
rank, class, or profession, indeed, formed an exception to this
rule. Nothing was so common in the morning as to meet men
of high rank and official dignity reeling home from a close in the
High Street, where they had spent the night in drinking. Nor
was it unusual to find two or three of His Majesty’s most honourable
Lords of Council and Session mounting the bench in the
forenoon in a crapulous state. A gentleman one night stepping
into Johnnie Dowie’s, opened a side-door, and looking
into the room, saw a sort of <em>agger</em> or heap of
snoring lads upon the floor, illumined by the gleams
of an expiring candle. ‘Wha may thae be, Mr
Dowie?’ inquired the visitor. ‘Oh,’ quoth John in
his usual quiet way, ‘just twa-three o’ Sir Willie’s
drucken clerks!’&mdash;meaning the young gentlemen
employed in Sir William Forbes’s banking-house,
whom of all earthly mortals one would have expected
to be observers of the decencies.</p>

<p>To this testimony may be added that of all
published works descriptive of Edinburgh during
the last century. Even in the preceding century,
if we are to believe Taylor the Water-poet, there
was no superabundance of sobriety in the town.
‘The worst thing,’ says that sly humorist in his
<cite>Journey</cite> (1623),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span> ‘was, that wine and ale were so
scarce, and the people such misers of it, that every night, before
I went to bed, if any man had asked me a civil question, all the
wit in my head could not have made him a sober answer.’</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diurnal</i> of a Scottish judge<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of the beginning of the last
century, which I have perused, presents a striking picture of the
habits of men of business in that age. Hardly a night passes
without some expense being incurred at taverns, not always of
very good fame, where his lordship’s associates on the bench were
his boon-companions in the debauch. One is at a loss to understand
how men who drugged their understandings so habitually
could possess any share of vital faculty for the consideration
or transaction of business, or how they contrived to make a decent
appearance in the hours of duty. But, however difficult to be
accounted for, there seems no room to doubt that deep drinking
was compatible in many instances with good business talents, and
even application. Many living men connected with the Court of
Session can yet look back to a juvenile period of their lives when
some of the ablest advocates and most esteemed judges were
noted for their convivial habits. For example, a famous counsel
named Hay, who became a judge under the designation of Lord
Newton, was equally remarkable as a bacchanal and as a lawyer.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
He considered himself as only the better fitted for business that
he had previously imbibed six bottles of claret; and one of his
clerks afterwards declared that the best paper he ever knew his
lordship dictate was done after a debauch where that amount of
liquor had fallen to his share. It was of him that the famous
story is told of a client calling for him one day at four o’clock,
and being surprised to find him at dinner; when, on the client
saying to the servant that he had understood five to be Mr Hay’s
dinner-hour&mdash;‘Oh, but, sir,’ said the man, ‘it is his <em>yesterday’s
dinner</em>!’ M. Simond, who, in 1811, published a <cite>Tour in Scotland</cite>,
mentions his surprise, on stepping one morning into the Parliament
House, to find in the dignified capacity of a judge, and displaying
all the gravity suitable to the character, the very gentleman with
whom he had spent most of the preceding night in a fierce
debauch. This judge was Lord Newton.</p>

<p>Contemporary with this learned lord was another of marvellous
powers of drollery, of whom it is told, as a fact too notorious at
the time to be concealed, that he was one Sunday morning, not
long before church-time, found asleep among the paraphernalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
of the sweeps, in a shed appropriated to the keeping of these
articles at the end of the Town Guard-house in the High Street.
His lordship, in staggering homeward alone from a tavern during
the night, had tumbled into this place, where consciousness did
not revisit him till next day. Of another group of clever but
over-convivial lawyers of that age, it is related that, having set
to wine and cards on a Saturday evening, they were so cheated
out of all sense of time that the night passed before they thought
of separating. Unless they are greatly belied, the people passing
along Picardy Place next forenoon, on their way to church, were
perplexed by seeing a door open, and three gentlemen issue forth,
in all the disorder to be expected after a night of drunken vigils,
while a fourth, in his dressing-gown, held the door in one hand
and a lighted candle in the other, by way of showing them out!<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The <em>High Jinks</em> of Counsellor Pleydell, in <cite>Guy Mannering</cite>,
must have prepared many for these curious traits of a bypast
age; and Scott has further illustrated the subject by telling, in
his notes to that novel, an anecdote, which he appears to have
had upon excellent authority, respecting the elder President
Dundas of Arniston, father of Lord Melville. ‘It had been
thought very desirable, while that distinguished lawyer was king’s
counsel, that his assistance should be obtained in drawing up an
appeal case, which, as occasion for such writings then rarely
occurred, was held to be a matter of great nicety. The solicitor
employed for the appellant, attended by my informant, acting
as his clerk, went to the Lord Advocate’s chambers in the Fishmarket
Close, as I think. It was Saturday at noon, the court was
just dismissed, the Lord Advocate had changed his dress and
booted himself, and his servant and horses were at the foot of the
close to carry him to Arniston. It was scarcely possible to get
him to listen to a word respecting business. The wily agent,
however, on pretence of asking one or two questions, which would
not detain him half-an-hour, drew his lordship, who was no less
an eminent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-vivant</i> than a lawyer of unequalled talent, to take
a whet at a celebrated tavern, when the learned counsel became
gradually involved in a spirited discussion of the law points of the
case. At length it occurred to him that he might as well ride to
Arniston in the cool of the evening. The horses were directed
to be put into the stable, but not to be unsaddled. Dinner was
ordered, the law was laid aside for a time, and the bottle circulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
very freely. At nine o’clock at night, after he had been honouring
Bacchus for so many hours, the Lord Advocate ordered his horses
to be unsaddled&mdash;paper, pen, and ink were brought&mdash;he began
to dictate the appeal case, and continued at his task till four
o’clock the next morning. By next day’s post the solicitor sent
the case to London&mdash;a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i> of its kind; and in which, my
informant assured me, it was not necessary, on revisal, to correct
five words.’</p>

<p>It was not always that business and pleasure were so successfully
united. It is related that an eminent lawyer, who was
confined to his room by indisposition, having occasion for the
attendance of his clerk at a late hour, in order to draw up a
paper required on an emergency next morning, sent for and
found him at his usual tavern. The man, though remarkable
for the preservation of his faculties under severe application to
the bottle, was on this night further gone than usual. He was
able, however, to proceed to his master’s bedroom, and there
take his seat at the desk with the appearance of a sufficiently
collected mind, so that the learned counsel, imagining nothing
more wrong than usual, began to dictate from his couch. This
went on for two or three hours, till, the business being finished,
the barrister drew his curtain&mdash;to behold <em>Jamie</em> lost in a profound
sleep upon the table, with the paper still in virgin whiteness
before him!</p>

<p>One of the most notable jolly fellows of the last age was
James Balfour, an accountant, usually called <em>Singing Jamie
Balfour</em>, on account of his fascinating qualities as a vocalist.
There used to be a portrait of him in the Leith Golf-house,
representing him in the act of commencing the favourite song
of <em>When I ha’e a saxpence under my thoom</em>, with the suitable
attitude and a merriness of countenance justifying the traditionary
account of the man. Of Jacobite leanings, he is said to have
sung <cite>The wee German lairdie</cite>, <cite>Awa, Whigs, awa</cite>, and <cite>The sow’s
tail to Geordie</cite> with a degree of zest which there was no resisting.</p>

<p>Report speaks of this person as an amiable, upright, and able
man; so clever in business matters that he could do as much
in one hour as another man in three; always eager to quench
and arrest litigation rather than to promote it; and consequently
so much esteemed professionally that he could get business
whenever he chose to undertake it, which, however, he only did
when he felt himself in need of money. Nature had given him
a robust constitution, which enabled him to see out three sets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
boon-companions, but, after all, gave way before he reached
sixty. His custom, when anxious to repair the effects of intemperance,
was to wash his head and hands in cold water; this, it
is said, made him quite cool and collected almost immediately.
Pleasure being so predominant an object in his life, it was thought
surprising that at his death he was found in possession of some
little money.</p>

<p>The powers of Balfour as a singer of the Scotch songs of all
kinds, tender and humorous, are declared to have been marvellous;
and he had a happy gift of suiting them to occasions. Being a
great peacemaker, he would often accomplish his purpose by
introducing some ditty pat to the purpose, and thus dissolving
all rancour in a hearty laugh. Like too many of our countrymen,
he had a contempt for foreign music. One evening, in a company
where an Italian vocalist of eminence was present, he professed to
give a song in the manner of that country. Forth came a ridiculous
cantata to the tune of <cite>Aiken Drum</cite>, beginning: ‘There was
a wife in Peebles,’ which the wag executed with all the proper
graces, shakes, and appoggiaturas, making his friends almost expire
with suppressed laughter at the contrast between the style of
singing and the ideas conveyed in the song. At the conclusion,
their mirth was doubled by the foreigner saying very simply:
‘De music be very fine, but I no understand de words.’ A lady,
who lived in the Parliament Close, told a friend of mine that she
was wakened from her sleep one summer morning by a noise as
of singing, when, going to the window to learn what was the
matter, guess her surprise at seeing Jamie Balfour and some of
his boon-companions (evidently fresh from their wonted orgies),
singing <cite>The king shall enjoy his own again</cite>, on their knees,
around King Charles’s statue! One of Balfour’s favourite haunts
was a humble kind of tavern called <em>Jenny Ha’s</em>, opposite to
Queensberry House, where, it is said, Gay had boosed during his
short stay in Edinburgh, and to which it was customary for
gentlemen to adjourn from dinner-parties, in order to indulge in
claret from the butt, free from the usual domestic restraints.
Jamie’s potations here were principally of what was called <em>cappie
ale</em>&mdash;that is, ale in little wooden bowls&mdash;with wee thochts of
brandy in it. But, indeed, no one could be less exclusive than
he as to liquors. When he heard a bottle drawn in any house
he happened to be in, and observed the cork to give an unusually
smart report, he would call out: ‘Lassie, gi’e me a glass o’ <em>that</em>;’
as knowing that, whatever it was, it must be good of its kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott says, in one of his droll little missives to his
printer Ballantyne: ‘When the press does not follow me, I get
on slowly and ill, and put myself in mind of Jamie Balfour, who
could run, when he could not stand still.’ He here alludes to a
matter of fact, which the following anecdote will illustrate: Jamie,
in going home late from a debauch, happened to tumble into the
pit formed for the foundation of a
house in James’s Square. A gentleman
passing heard his complaint, and
going up to the spot, was entreated
by our hero to help him out.
‘What would be the use of helping
you out,’ said the passer-by, ‘when
you could not stand though you
<em>were</em> out?’ ‘Very true, perhaps;
yet if you help me up, I’ll <em>run</em> you
to the Tron Kirk for a bottle of
claret.’ Pleased with his humour,
the gentleman placed him upon his
feet, when instantly he set off for
the Tron Church at a pace distancing
all ordinary competition; and
accordingly he won the race, though,
at the conclusion, he had to sit down
on the steps of the church, being
quite unable to stand. After taking
a minute or two to recover his
breath&mdash;‘Well, another race to
Fortune’s for another bottle of
claret!’ Off he went to the tavern
in question, in the Stamp-office
Close, and this bet he gained also.
The claret, probably with continuations,
was discussed in Fortune’s; and the end of the story is,
Balfour sent his new friend home in a chair, utterly done up, at
an early hour in the morning.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that habits carried to such an extravagance
amongst gentlemen should have in some small degree
affected the fairer and purer part of creation also. It is an old
story in Edinburgh that three ladies had one night a merry-meeting
in a tavern near the Cross, where they sat till a very
late hour. Ascending at length to the street, they scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
remembered where they were; but as it was good moonlight,
they found little difficulty in walking along till they came to the
Tron Church. Here, however, an obstacle occurred. The moon,
shining high in the south, threw the shadow of the steeple directly
across the street from the one side to the other; and the ladies,
being no more clear-sighted than they were clear-headed, mistook
this for a broad and rapid river, which they would require to cross
before making further way. In this delusion, they sat down upon
the brink of the imaginary stream, deliberately took off their shoes
and stockings, <em>kilted</em> their lower garments, and proceeded to wade
through to the opposite side; after which, resuming their shoes
and stockings, they went on their way rejoicing, as before!
Another anecdote (from an aged nobleman) exhibits the bacchanalian
powers of our ancestresses in a different light. During the
rising of 1715, the officers of the crown in Edinburgh, having
procured some important intelligence respecting the motions and
intentions of the Jacobites, resolved upon despatching the same
to London by a faithful courier. Of this the party whose interests
would have been so materially affected got notice; and that
evening, as the messenger (a man of rank) was going down the
High Street, with the intention of mounting his horse in the
Canongate and immediately setting off, he met two tall, handsome
ladies, in full dress, and wearing black velvet masks, who accosted
him with a very easy demeanour and a winning sweetness of
voice. Without hesitating as to the quality of these damsels, he
instantly proposed to treat them with a pint of claret at a
neighbouring tavern; but they said that, instead of accepting his
kindness, they were quite willing to treat <em>him</em> to his heart’s
content. They then adjourned to the tavern, and sitting down,
the whole three drank plenteously, merrily, and long, so that the
courier seemed at last to forget entirely the mission upon which
he was sent, and the danger of the papers which he had about
his person. After a pertinacious debauch of several hours, the
luckless messenger was at length fairly drunk under the table;
and it is needless to add that the fair nymphs then proceeded
to strip him of his papers, decamped, and were no more heard
of; though it is but justice to the Scottish ladies of that period
to say that the robbers were generally believed at the time to
be young men disguised in women’s clothes.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span></p>
<p>The custom which prevailed among ladies, as well as gentlemen,
of resorting to what were called <em>oyster-cellars</em>, is in itself a striking
indication of the state of manners during the last century. In
winter, when the evening had set in, a party of the most fashionable
people in town, collected by appointment, would adjourn in
carriages to one of those abysses of darkness and comfort, called
in Edinburgh <em>laigh shops</em>, where they proceeded to regale themselves
with raw oysters and porter, arranged in huge dishes upon
a coarse table, in a dingy room, lighted by tallow candles. The
rudeness of the feast, and the vulgarity of the circumstances under
which it took place, seem to have given a zest to its enjoyment,
with which more refined banquets could not have been accompanied.
One of the chief features of an oyster-cellar entertainment was
that full scope was given to the conversational powers of the
company. Both ladies and gentlemen indulged, without restraint,
in sallies the merriest and the wittiest; and a thousand remarks
and jokes, which elsewhere would have been suppressed as improper,
were here sanctified by the oddity of the scene, and appreciated
by the most dignified and refined. After the table was cleared of
the oysters and porter, it was customary to introduce brandy or
rum-punch&mdash;according to the pleasure of the ladies&mdash;after which
dancing took place; and when the female part of the assemblage
thought proper to retire, the gentlemen again sat down, or
adjourned to another tavern to crown the pleasures of the evening
with unlimited debauch. It is not (1824) more than thirty years
since the late Lord Melville, the Duchess of Gordon, and some
other persons of distinction, who happened to meet in town after
many years of absence, made up an oyster-cellar party, by way
of a frolic, and devoted one winter evening to the revival of this
almost forgotten entertainment of their youth.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span></p>
<p>It seems difficult to reconcile all these things with the staid
and somewhat square-toed character which our country has obtained
amongst her neighbours. The fact seems to be that a kind of
Laodicean principle is observable in Scotland, and we oscillate
between a rigour of manners on the one hand, and a laxity on
the other, which alternately acquire an apparent paramouncy. In
the early part of the last century, rigour was in the ascendant;
but not to the prevention of a respectable minority of the free-and-easy,
who kept alive the flame of conviviality with no small
degree of success. In the latter half of the century&mdash;a dissolute
era all over civilised Europe&mdash;the minority became the majority,
and the characteristic sobriety of the nation’s manners was only
traceable in certain portions of society. Now we are in a sober,
perhaps tending to a rigorous stage once more. In Edinburgh,
seventy years ago (1847), intemperance was the rule to such an
degree that exception could hardly be said to exist. Men appeared
little in the drawing-room in those days; when they did, not
infrequently their company had better have been dispensed with.
When a gentleman gave an entertainment, it was thought necessary
that he should press the bottle as far as it could be made to go.
A particularly good fellow would lock his outer door to prevent
any guest of dyspeptic tendencies or sober inclinations from
escaping. Some were so considerate as to provide shake-down
beds for a general bivouac in a neighbouring apartment. When
gentlemen were obliged to appear at assemblies where decency
was enforced, they of course wore their best attire. This it was
customary to change for something less liable to receive damage,
ere going, as they usually did, to conclude the evening by a
scene of conviviality. Drinking entered into everything. As Sir
Alexander Boswell has observed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘O’er draughts of wine the beau would moan his love,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er draughts of wine the cit his bargain drove,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er draughts of wine the writer penned the will,</div>
<div class="verse">And legal wisdom counselled o’er a gill.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then was the time when men, despising and neglecting the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
of women, always so civilising in its influence, would yet
half-kill themselves with bumpers in order, as the phrase went, to
<em>save them</em>. Drinking to save the ladies is said to have originated
with a catch-club, which issued tickets for gratuitous concerts.
Many tickets with the names of ladies being prepared, one was
taken up and the name announced. Any member present was
at liberty to toast the health of this lady in a bumper, and this
ensured her ticket being reserved for her use. If no one came
forward to honour her name in this manner, the lady was said to
be damned, and her ticket was thrown under the table. Whether
from this origin or not, the practice is said to have ultimately had
the following form. One gentleman would give out the name of
some lady as the most beautiful object in creation, and, by way
of attesting what he said, drink one bumper. Another champion
would then enter the field, and offer to prove that a certain other
lady, whom he named, was a great deal more beautiful than she
just mentioned&mdash;supporting his assertion by drinking two bumpers.
Then the other would rise up, declare this to be false, and in
proof of his original statement, as well as by way of turning the
scale upon his opponent, drink four bumpers. Not deterred or
repressed by this, the second man would reiterate, and conclude
by drinking as much as the challenger, who would again start up
and drink eight bumpers; and so on, in geometrical progression,
till one or other of the heroes fell under the table; when of course
the fair Delia of the survivor was declared the queen supreme
of beauty by all present. I have seen a sonnet addressed
on the morning after such a scene of contention to the lady
concerned by the unsuccessful hero, whose brains appear to have
been woefully muddled by the claret he had drunk in her behalf.</p>

<p>It was not merely in the evenings that taverns were then
resorted to. There was a petty treat, called a ‘meridian,’ which
no man of that day thought himself able to dispense with; and
this was generally indulged in at a tavern. ‘A cauld cock and
a feather’ was the metaphorical mode of calling for a glass of
brandy and a bunch of raisins, which was the favourite regale of
many. Others took a glass of whisky, some few a lunch. Scott
very amusingly describes, from his own observation, the manner
in which the affair of the meridian was gone about by the writers
and clerks belonging to the Parliament House. ‘If their proceedings
were watched, they might be seen to turn fidgety about
the hour of noon, and exchange looks with each other from their
separate desks, till at length some one of formal and dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
presence assumed the honour of leading the band; when away
they went, threading the crowd like a string of wild-fowl, crossed
the square or close, and following each other into the [John’s]
coffee-house, drank the meridian, which was placed ready at the
bar. This they did day by day; and though they did not speak
to each other, they seemed to attach a certain degree of sociability
to performing the ceremony in company.’</p>

<p>It was in the evening, of course, that the tavern debaucheries
assumed their proper character of unpalliated fierceness and
destructive duration. In the words of Robert Fergusson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>All the shops in the town were then shut at eight o’clock; and
from that hour till ten&mdash;when the drum of the Town-guard
announced at once a sort of license for the deluging of the streets
with nuisances,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and a warning of the inhabitants home to their
beds&mdash;unrestrained scope was given to the delights of the table.
No tradesman thought of going home to his family till after he
had spent an hour or two at his club. This was universal and
unfailing. So lately as 1824, I knew something of an old-fashioned
tradesman who nightly shut his shop at eight o’clock, and then
adjourned with two old friends, who called upon him at that hour,
to a quiet old public-house on the opposite side of the way,
where they each drank precisely one bottle of Edinburgh ale, ate
precisely one halfpenny roll, and got upon their legs precisely
at the first stroke of ten o’clock.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span></p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Cape Club</span> alluded to by Fergusson aspired to a refined
and classical character, comprising amongst its numerous members
many men of talents, as well as of private worth. Fergusson
himself was a member; as were Mr Thomas Sommers, his friend
and biographer; Mr Woods, a player of eminence on the humble
boards of Edinburgh, and an intimate companion of the poet;
and Mr Runciman the painter. The name of the club had its
foundation in one of those weak jokes such as ‘gentle dullness
ever loves.’ A person who lived in the Calton was in the custom
of spending an hour or two every evening with one or two city
friends, and being sometimes detained till after the regular period
when the Netherbow Port was shut, it occasionally happened that
he had either to remain in the city all night, or was under the
necessity of bribing the porter who attended the gate. This
difficult <em>pass</em>&mdash;partly on account of the rectangular corner which
he turned immediately on getting out of the Port, as he went
homewards down Leith Wynd&mdash;the Calton burgher facetiously
called <em>doubling the Cape</em>; and as it was customary with his friends
every evening when they assembled to inquire ‘how he turned
the Cape last night,’ and indeed to make that circumstance and
that phrase, night after night, the subject of their conversation
and amusement, ‘the Cape’ in time became so assimilated with
their very existence that they adopted it as a title; and it was
retained as such by the organised club into which shortly after
they thought proper to form themselves. The Cape Club owned
a regular institution from 1763. It will scarcely be credited in
the present day that a jest of the above nature could keep an
assemblage of rational citizens, and, we may add, professed wits,
merry after a thousand repetitions. Yet it really is true that
the patron-jests of many a numerous and enlightened association
were no better than this, and the greater part of them worse.
As instance the following:</p>

<p>There was the <span class="smcap">Antemanum Club</span>, of which the members used to
boast of the state of their hands, <em>before-hand</em>, in playing at ‘Brag.’
The members were all men of respectability, some of them gentlemen
of fortune. They met every Saturday and dined. It was at
first a purely convivial club; but latterly, the Whig party gaining
a sort of preponderance, it degenerated into a political association.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pious Club</span> was composed of decent, orderly citizens, who
met every night, Sundays not excepted, in a <em>pie-house</em>, and whose
joke was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">équivoque</i> of these expressions&mdash;similar in sound, but
different in signification. The agreeable uncertainty as to whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
their name arose from their <em>piety</em>, or the circumstance of their
eating <em>pies</em>, kept the club hearty for many years. At their Sunday
meetings the conversation usually took a serious turn&mdash;perhaps
upon the sermons which they had
respectively heard during the day:
this they considered as rendering
their title of <em>Pious</em> not altogether
undeserved. Moreover, they were
all, as the saying was, <em>ten o’clock
men</em>, and of good character. Fifteen
persons were considered as
constituting a full night. The
whole allowable debauch was a gill
of toddy to each person, which was
drunk, like wine, out of a common
decanter. One of the members of
the Pious Club was a Mr Lind, a
man of at least twenty-five stone
weight, immoderately fond of good
eating and drinking. It was generally
believed of him that were all
the oxen he had devoured ranged in
a line, they would reach from the Watergate to the Castle-hill, and
that the wine he had drunk would swim a seventy-four. His most
favourite viand was a very strange one&mdash;salmon skins. When
dining anywhere, with salmon on the table, he made no scruple of
raking all the skins off the plates of the rest of the guests. He
had only one toast, from which he never varied: ‘Merry days to
honest fellows.’ A Mr Drummond was esteemed poet-laureate to
this club. He was a facetious, clever man. Of his poetical talents,
take a specimen in the following lines on Lind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘In going to dinner, he ne’er lost his way,</div>
<div class="verse">Though often, when done, he was carted away.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He made the following impromptu on an associate of small figure
and equally small understanding, who had been successful in the
world:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘O thou of genius slow,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Weak by nature;</div>
<div class="verse">A rich fellow,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But a poor creature.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Watergate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Spendthrift Club</span> took its name from the extravagance of
the members in spending no less a sum than fourpence halfpenny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
each night! It consisted of respectable citizens of the middle
class, and continued in 1824 to exist in a modified state. Its
meetings, originally nightly, were then reduced to four a week.
The men used to play at whist for a halfpenny&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;no
rubbers; but latterly they had, with their characteristic
extravagance, doubled the stake! Supper originally cost no less
than twopence; and half a bottle of strong ale, with a dram, stood
every member twopence halfpenny; to all which sumptuous profusion
might be added still another halfpenny, which was given to
the maid-servant&mdash;in all, fivepence! Latterly the dram had been
disused; but such had been the general increase, either in the
cost or the quantity of the indulgences, that the usual nightly
expense was ultimately from a shilling to one and fourpence. The
winnings at whist were always thrown into the reckoning. A large
two-quart bottle or tappit-hen was introduced by the landlady,
with a small measure, out of which the company helped themselves;
and the members made up their own bill with chalk upon the table.
In 1824, in the recollection of the senior members, some of whom
were of fifty years’ standing, the house was kept by the widow of
a Lieutenant Hamilton of the army, who recollected having
attended the theatre in the Tennis Court at Holyroodhouse, when
the play was the <cite>Spanish Friar</cite>, and when many of the members
of the <em>Union Parliament</em> were present in the house.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Boar Club</span> was an association of a different sort, consisting
chiefly of wild, fashionable young men; and the place of meeting
was not in any of the snug profundities of the Old Town,
but in a modern tavern in Shakspeare Square, kept by
one Daniel Hogg. The <em>joke</em> of this club consisted in
the supposition that all the members were <em>boars</em>, that
their room was a <em>sty</em>, that their talk was <em>grunting</em>,
and in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double-entendre</i> of the small piece of stone-ware
which served as a repository of all the fines being
a <em>pig</em>. Upon this they lived twenty years. I have, at
some expense of eyesight and with no small exertion of
patience, perused the soiled and blotted records of the
club, which in 1824 were preserved by an old vintner,
whose house was their last place of meeting; and
the result has been the following memorabilia.
The Boar Club commenced its meetings in 1787,
and the original members were J. G. C. Schetky,
a German musician; David Shaw; Archibald
Crawfuird; Patrick Robertson; Robert Aldridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
a famed pantomimist and dancing-master; James Neilson;
and Luke Cross. Some of these were remarkable men, in particular
Mr Schetky. He had come to Edinburgh about the beginning of
the reign of George III. He used to tell that on alighting at
Ramsay’s inn, opposite the Cowgate Port, his first impression of
the city was so unfavourable that he was on the point of leaving
it again without further acquaintance, and was only prevented
from doing so by the solicitations of his fellow-traveller, who was
not so much alarmed at the dingy and squalid appearance of this
part of Auld Reekie.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He was first employed at St Cecilia’s Hall,
where the concerts were attended by all the ‘rank, beauty, and
fashion’ of which Edinburgh could then boast, and where, besides
the professional performers, many amateurs of great musical skill
and enthusiasm, such as Mr Tytler of Woodhouselee,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> were pleased
to exhibit themselves for the entertainment of their friends, who
alone were admitted by tickets. Mr Schetky composed the march
of a body of volunteers called the Edinburgh Defensive Band,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
which was raised out of the citizens of Edinburgh at the time of
the American war, and was commanded by the eminent advocate
Crosbie. One of the verses to which the march was set may be
given as an admirable specimen of <em>militia poetry</em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Colonel Crosbie takes the field;</div>
<div class="verse">To France and Spain he will not yield;</div>
<div class="verse">But still maintains his high command</div>
<div class="verse">At the head of the noble Defensive Band.’<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></div>

<p>Mr Schetky was primarily concerned in the founding of the Boar
Club. He was in the habit of meeting every night with Mr
Aldridge and one or two other professional men, or gentlemen
who affected the society of such persons, in Hogg’s tavern; and it
was the host’s name that suggested the idea of calling their society
the ‘<em>Boar</em> Club.’ Their laws were first written down in proper
form in 1790. They were to meet every evening at seven o’clock;
each <em>boar</em>, on his entry, to contribute a halfpenny to the <em>pig</em>. Mr
Aldridge was to be perpetual <em>Grand-boar</em>, with Mr Schetky for his
deputy; and there were other officers, entitled Secretary, Treasurer,
and Procurator-fiscal. A fine of one halfpenny was imposed upon
every person who called one of his brother-boars by his proper out-of-club
name&mdash;the term ‘sir’ being only allowed. The entry-moneys,
fines, and other pecuniary acquisitions were hoarded for a
grand annual dinner. The laws were revised in 1799, when some
new officials were constituted, such as Poet-laureate, Champion,
Archbishop, and Chief-grunter. The fines were then rendered
exceedingly severe, and in their exaction no one met with any
mercy, as it was the interest of all the rest that the <em>pig</em> should
bring forth as plenteous a <em>farrow</em> as possible at the grand dinner-day.
This practice at length occasioning a violent insurrection in
the <em>sty</em>, the whole fraternity was broken up, and never again
returned to ‘wallow in the mire.’</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hell-fire Club</span>, a terrible and infamous association of wild
young men about the beginning of the last century, met in various
profound places throughout Edinburgh, where they practised
orgies not more fit for seeing the light than the Eleusinian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
Mysteries. I have conversed with old people who had seen the
last worn-out members of the Hell-fire Club, which in the country
is to this day believed to have been an association in compact with
the Prince of Darkness.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, a set of persons associated for the purpose
of purchasing goods condemned by the Court of Exchequer.
For what reason I cannot tell, they called themselves the Hell-fire
Club, and their president was named the Devil. My old friend,
Henry Mackenzie, whose profession was that of an attorney before
the Court of Exchequer, wrote me a note on this subject, in which
he says very naïvely: ‘In my youngest days, I knew the Devil.’</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sweating Club</span> flourished about the middle of the last
century. They resembled the Mohocks mentioned in the <cite>Spectator</cite>.
After intoxicating themselves, it was their custom to sally forth at
midnight, and attack whomsoever they met upon the streets. Any
luckless wight who happened to fall into their hands was chased,
jostled, pinched, and pulled about, till he not only perspired, but
was ready to drop down and die with exhaustion. Even so late as
the early years of this century, it was unsafe to walk the streets of
Edinburgh at night on account of the numerous drunken parties
of young men who then reeled about, bent on mischief, at all hours,
and from whom the Town-guard were unable to protect the sober
citizen.</p>

<p>A club called the <span class="smcap">Industrious Company</span> may serve to show how
far the system of drinking was carried by our fathers. It was a
sort of joint-stock company, formed by a numerous set of porter-drinkers,
who thought fit to club towards the formation of a stock
of that liquor, which they might partly profit by retailing, and
partly by the opportunity thus afforded them of drinking their
own particular tipple at the wholesale price. Their cellars were
in the Royal Bank Close, where they met every night at eight
o’clock. Each member paid at his entry £5, and took his turn
monthly of the duty of superintending the general business of the
company. But the curse of joint-stock companies&mdash;negligence on
the part of the managers&mdash;ultimately occasioned the ruin of the
Industrious Company.</p>

<p>About 1790, a club of first-rate citizens used to meet each
Saturday afternoon for a <em>country dinner</em>, in a tavern which still
exists in the village of Canonmills, a place now involved within
the limits of the New Town. To quote a brief memoir on the
subject, handed to me many years ago by a veteran friend, who
was a good deal of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudator temporis acti</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span> ‘The club was
pointedly attended; it was too good a thing to miss being present
at. They kept their own claret, and managed all matters as to
living perfectly well.’ Originally the fraternity were contented
with a very humble room; but in time they got an addition built
to the house for their accommodation, comprehending one good-sized
room with two windows, in one of which is a pane containing
an olive-dove; in the other, one containing a wheat-sheaf, both
engraved with a diamond. ‘This,’ continues Mr Johnston, ‘was
the doing of William Ramsay [banker], then residing at Warriston&mdash;the
tongue of the trump to the club. Here he took great
delight to drink claret on the Saturdays, though he had such a
paradise near at hand to retire to; but then there were Jamie
Torry, Jamie Dickson, Gilbert Laurie, and other good old council
friends with whom to crack [that is, chat]; and the said cracks
were of more value in this dark, unseemly place than the enjoyments
of home. I never pass these two engraved panes of glass
but I venerate them, and wonder that, in the course of fifty years,
they have not been destroyed, either from drunkenness within or
from misrule without.’<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Edinburgh boasted of many other associations of the like nature,

<p>And so forth. There were the <span class="smcap">Caledonian Club</span> and the <span class="smcap">Union
Club</span>, of whose foundation history speaketh not. There was the
<span class="smcap">Wig Club</span>, the president of which wore a wig of extraordinary
materials, which had belonged to the Moray family for three
generations, and each new <em>entrant</em> of which drank to the fraternity
in a quart of claret without pulling bit. The Wigs usually drank
twopenny ale, on which it was possible to get satisfactorily drunk
for a groat; and with this they ate souters’ clods,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> a coarse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
lumpish kind of loaf.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> There was also the <span class="smcap">Brownonian System
Club</span>, which, oddly enough, bore no reference to the license which
that system had given for a phlogistic regimen&mdash;for it was a douce
citizenly fraternity, venerating ten o’clock as a sacred principle&mdash;but
in honour of the founder of that system, who had been a
constituent member.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lawnmarket Club</span> was composed chiefly of the woollen-traders
of that street, a set of whom met every morning about
seven o’clock, and walked down to the Post-office, where they
made themselves acquainted with the news of the morning. After
a plentiful discussion of the news, they adjourned to a public-house
and got a dram of brandy. As a sort of ironical and self-inflicted
satire upon the strength of their potations, they sometimes
called themselves the <em>Whey Club</em>. They were always the first
persons in the town to have a thorough knowledge of the foreign
news; and on Wednesday mornings, when there was no post from
London, it was their wont to meet as usual, and, in the absence
of real news, amuse themselves by the invention of what was
imaginary; and this they made it their business to circulate
among their uninitiated acquaintances in the course of the forenoon.
Any such unfounded articles of intelligence, on being
suspected or discovered, were usually called <em>Lawnmarket Gazettes</em>,
in allusion to their roguish originators.</p>

<p>In the year 1705, when the Duke of Argyll was commissioner
in the Scottish parliament, a singular kind of fashionable club, or
coterie of ladies and gentlemen, was instituted, chiefly by the
exertions of the Earl of Selkirk, who was the distinguished beau
of that age. This was called the <span class="smcap">Horn Order</span>, a name which, as
usual, had its origin in the whim of a moment. A horn-spoon
having been used at some merry-meeting, it occurred to the club,
which was then in embryo, that this homely implement would be
a good badge for the projected society; and this being proposed,
it was instantly agreed by all the party that the ‘Order of the
Horn’ would be a good caricature of the more ancient and better-sanctioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
honorary dignities. The phrase was adopted; and the
members of the <em>Horn Order</em> met and caroused for many a day
under this strange designation, which, however, the common
people believed to mean more than met the ear. Indeed, if all
accounts of it be true, it must have been a species of masquerade,
in which the sexes were mixed and all ranks confounded.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>When the worship of Bacchus held such sway in our city, his
peculiar temples&mdash;the taverns&mdash;must, one would suppose,
have been places of some importance. And so they were, comparatively
speaking; and yet, absolutely, an Edinburgh tavern of
the last century was no very fine or inviting place. Usually these
receptacles were situated in obscure places&mdash;in courts or closes,
away from the public thoroughfares; and often they presented
such narrow and stifling accommodations as might have been
expected to repel rather than attract visitors. The truth was,
however, that a coarse and darksome snugness was courted by
the worshippers. Large, well-lighted rooms, with a look-out to a
street, would not have suited them. But allow them to dive
through some Erebean alley, into a cavern-like house, and there
settle themselves in a cell unvisited of Phœbus, with some dingy
flamen of either sex to act as minister, and their views as to
circumstances and properties were fulfilled.</p>

<p>The city traditions do not go far back into the eighteenth
century with respect to taverns; but we obtain some notion of the
principal houses in Queen Anne’s time from the Latin lyrics of
Dr Pitcairn, which Ruddiman published, in order to prove that
the Italian muse had not become extinct in our land since the
days of Buchanan. In an address <cite>To Strangers</cite>, the wit tells
those who would acquire some notion of our national manners to
avoid the triple church of St Giles’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Tres ubi Cyclopes fanda nefanda boant’&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>where three horrible monsters bellow forth sacred and profane discourse&mdash;and
seek the requisite knowledge in the sanctuaries of the
rosy god, whose worship is conducted by night and by day. ‘At
one time,’ says he, ‘you may be delighted with the bowls of Steil
of the <em>Cross Keys</em>; then other heroes, at the <em>Ship</em>, will show you
the huge cups which belonged to mighty bibbers of yore. Or you
may seek out the sweet-spoken Katy at <em>Buchanan’s</em>, or <em>Tennant’s</em>
commodious house, where scalloped oysters will be brought in with
your wine. But <em>Hay</em> calls us, than whom no woman of milder
disposition or better-stored cellar can be named in the whole town.
Now it will gratify you to make your way into the Avernian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
grottoes and caves never seen of the sun; but remember to make
friends with the dog which guards the threshold. Straightway
Mistress Anne will bring the native liquor. Seek the innermost
rooms and the snug seats: these know the sun, at least, when
Anne enters. What souls joying in the Lethæan flood you may
there see! what frolics, God willing, you may partake of! Mindless
of all that goes on in the outer world, joys not to be
told to mortal do they there imbibe. But perhaps you may
wish by-and-by to get back into the world&mdash;which is indeed no
easy matter. I recommend you, when about to descend, to take
with you a trusty Achates [a caddy]: say to Anne, “Be sure you
give him no drink.” By such means it was that Castor and Pollux
were able to issue forth from Pluto’s domain into the heavenly
spaces. Here you may be both merry and wise; but beware how
you toast kings and their French retreats,’ &amp;c. The sites of
these merry places of yore are not handed down to us; but
respecting another, which Pitcairn shadows forth under the
mysterious appellation of <em>Greppa</em>, it chances that we possess some
knowledge. It was a suite of dark underground apartments in
the Parliament Close, opening by a descending stair opposite the
oriel of St Giles’s, in a mass of building called the Pillars. By the
wits who frequented it, it was called the <em>Greping-office</em>, because
one could only make way through its dark passages by groping.
It is curious to see how Pitcairn works this homely Scottish idea
into his Sapphics, talking, for example, by way of a good case of
bane and antidote, of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Fraudes Egidii, venena Greppæ.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A venerable person has given me an anecdote of this singular
mixture of learning, wit, and professional skill in connection with
the Greping-office. Here, it seems, according to a custom which
lasted even in London till a later day, the clever physician used
to receive visits from his patients. On one occasion a woman
from the country called to consult him respecting the health of
her daughter, when he gave a shrewd hygienic advice in a pithy
metaphor not be mentioned to ears polite. When, in consequence
of following the prescription, the young woman had recovered her
health, the mother came back to the Greping-office to thank Dr
Pitcairn and give him a small present. Seeing him in precisely
the same place and circumstances, and surrounded by the same
companions as on the former occasion, she lingered with an
expression of surprise. On interrogation, she said she had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
one thing to speer at him (ask after), and she hoped he would not
be angry.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, my good woman.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, have you been sitting here ever since I saw you
last?’</p>

<p>According to the same authority, small claret was then sold at
twentypence the Scottish pint, equivalent to tenpence a bottle.
Pitcairn once or twice sent his servant for a regale of this liquor
on the Sunday forenoon, and suffered the disappointment of having
it intercepted by the <em>seizers</em>, whose duty it was to make capture
of all persons found abroad in time of service, and appropriate
whatever they were engaged in carrying that smelled of the
common enjoyments of life. To secure his claret for the future
from this interference, the wit caused the wine on one occasion to
be drugged in such a manner as to produce consequences more
ludicrous than dangerous to those drinking it. The triumph he
thus attained over a power which there was no reaching by any
appeal to common-sense or justice must have been deeply relished
in the Greping-office.</p>

<p>Pitcairn was professedly an Episcopalian, but he allowed himself
a latitude in wit which his contemporaries found some difficulty
in reconciling with any form of religion. Among the popular
charges against him was that he did not believe in the existence
of such a place as hell; a point of heterodoxy likely to be sadly
disrelished in Scotland. Being at a book-sale, where a copy of
Philostratus sold at a good price and a copy of the Bible was not
bidden for, Pitcairn said to some one who remarked the circumstance:
‘Not at all wonderful; for is it not written, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum Dei
manet in eternum</i>”?’ For this, one of the <em>Cyclopes</em>, a famous Mr
Webster, called him publicly an atheist. The story goes on to
state that Pitcairn prosecuted Webster for defamation in consequence,
but failed in the action from the following circumstance:
The defender, much puzzled what to do in the case, consulted a
shrewd-witted friend of his, a Mr Pettigrew, minister of Govan,
near Glasgow. Pettigrew came to Edinburgh to endeavour to
get him out of the scrape. ‘Strange,’ he said, ‘since he has
caught so much at your mouth, if we can catch nothing at his.’
Having laid his plan, he came bustling up to the physician at
the Cross, and tapping him on the shoulder, said: ‘Are you Dr
Pitcairn the atheist?’</p>

<p>The doctor, in his haste, overlooking the latter part of the
query, answered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span> ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ said Pettigrew; ‘I take you all to witness that he
has confessed it himself.’</p>

<p>Pitcairn, seeing how he had been outwitted, said bitterly to the
minister of Govan, whom he well knew: ‘Oh, Pettigrew, that
skull of yours is as deep as hell.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, man,’ replied Pettigrew, ‘I’m glad to find you have come
to believe there is a hell.’ The prosecutor’s counsel, who stood
by at the time, recommended a compromise, which accordingly
took place.</p>

<p>A son of Pitcairn was minister of Dysart; a very good kind
of man, who was sometimes consulted in a medical way by his
parishioners. He seems to have had a little of the paternal
humour, if we may judge from the following circumstance: A lady
came to ask what her maid-servant should do for sore or tender
eyes. The minister, seeing that no active treatment could be
recommended, said: ‘She must do naething wi’ them, but just
rub them wi’ her elbucks [elbows].’</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay mentions, of Edinburgh taverns in his day,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Cumin’s, Don’s, and Steil’s,’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>as places where one may be as well served as at <em>The Devil</em> in
London.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<span class="smcap">John Maclaurin.</span>
</p></div></div>

<p>One is disposed to pause a moment on Steil’s name, as it is
honourably connected with the history of music in Scotland.
Being a zealous lover of the divine science and a good singer of
the native melodies, he had rendered his house a favourite resort
of all who possessed a similar taste, and here actually was formed
(1728) the first regular society of amateur musicians known in
our country. It numbered seventy persons, and met once a
week, the usual entertainments consisting in playing on the
harpsichord and violin the concertos and sonatas of Handel,
then newly published. Apparently, however, this fraternity did
not long continue to use Steil’s house, if I am right in supposing
his retirement from business as announced in an advertisement
of February 1729, regarding ‘a sale by auction, of the haill
pictures, prints, music-books, and musical instruments, belonging
to Mr John Steill’ (<cite>Caledonian Mercury</cite>).</p>

<p>Coming down to a later time&mdash;1760-1770&mdash;we find the tavern
in highest vogue to have been <em>Fortune’s</em>, in the house which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
Earl of Eglintoune had once occupied in the Stamp-office Close.
The gay men of rank, the scholarly and philosophical, the common
citizens, all flocked hither; and the royal commissioner for the
General Assembly held his levees here, and hence proceeded to
church with his cortège, then additionally splendid from having
ladies walking in it in their court-dresses as well as gentlemen.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
Perhaps the most remarkable set of men who met here was the
<span class="smcap">Poker Club</span>,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> consisting of Hume, Robertson, Blair, Fergusson, and
many others of that brilliant galaxy, but whose potations were
comparatively of a moderate kind.</p>

<p>The <em>Star and Garter</em>, in Writers’ Court, kept by one Clerihugh
(the <em>Clerihugh’s</em> alluded to in <cite>Guy Mannering</cite>), was another
tavern of good consideration, the favourite haunt of the magistrates
and Town-council, who in those days mixed much more
of private enjoyments with public duties than would now be
considered fitting.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Here the Rev. Dr Webster used to meet them
at dinner, in order to give them the benefit of his extensive knowledge
and great powers of calculation when they were scheming
out the New Town.</p>

<p>A favourite house for many of the last years of the bygone
century was <em>Douglas’s</em>, in the Anchor Close, near the Cross, a
good specimen of those profound retreats which have been spoken
of as valued in the inverse ratio of the amount of daylight which
visited them. You went a few yards down the dark, narrow alley,
passing on the left hand the entry to a scale stair, decorated with
‘<span class="smcap lowercase">THE LORD IS ONLY MY SVPORT</span>;’ then passed another door,
bearing the still more antique legend: ‘<span class="smcap lowercase">O LORD, IN THE IS AL MY
TRAIST</span>;’ immediately beyond, under an architrave calling out
‘<span class="smcap lowercase">BE MERCIFVL TO ME</span>,’ you entered the hospitable mansion of
Dawney Douglas, the scene of the daily and nightly orgies of the
Pleydells and Fairfords, the Hays, Erskines, and Crosbies, of the
time of our fathers. Alas! how fallen off is now that temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
of Momus and the Bacchanals! You find it divided into a
multitude of small lodgings, where, instead of the merry party,
vociferous with toasts and catches, you are most likely to be struck
by the spectacle of some poor lone female, pining under a parochial
allowance, or a poverty-struck family group, one-half of whom are
disposed on sick-beds of straw mingled with rags&mdash;the terrible
exponents of our peculiar phasis of civilisation.</p>

<p>The frequenter of Douglas’s, after ascending a few steps, found
himself in a pretty large kitchen&mdash;a dark, fiery Pandemonium,
through which numerous ineffable ministers of flame were continually
flying about, while beside the door sat the landlady, a large,
fat woman, in a towering head-dress and large-flowered silk gown,
who bowed to every one passing. Most likely on emerging from
this igneous region, the party would fall into the hands of Dawney
himself, and so be conducted to an apartment. A perfect contrast
was he to his wife: a thin, weak, submissive man, who spoke in a
whisper, never but in the way of answer, and then, if possible,
only in monosyllables. He had a habit of using the word
‘quietly’ very frequently, without much regard to its being
appropriate to the sense; and it is told that he one day made the
remark that ‘the Castle had been firing to-day&mdash;<em>quietly</em>;’ which,
it may well be believed, was not soon forgotten by his customers.
Another trait of Dawney was that some one lent him a volume of
Clarendon’s history to read, and daily frequenting the room
where it lay, used regularly, for some time, to put back the reader’s
mark to the same place; whereupon, being by-and-by asked how
he liked the book, Dawney answered: ‘Oh, very weel; but dinna
ye think it’s gay mickle the same thing o’er again?’ The house
was noted for suppers of tripe, rizzared haddocks, mince collops,
and <em>hashes</em>, which never cost more than sixpence a head. On
charges of this moderate kind the honest couple grew extremely
rich before they died.</p>

<p>The principal room in this house was a handsome one of good
size, having a separate access by the second of the entries which
have been described, and only used for large companies, or for
guests of the first importance. It was called <em>the Crown Room</em>, or
<em>the Crown</em>&mdash;so did the guests find it distinguished on the tops of
their bills&mdash;and this name it was said to have acquired in consequence
of its having once been used by Queen Mary as a council-room,
on which occasions the emblem of sovereignty was disposed
in a niche in the wall, still existing. How the queen should have
had any occasion to hold councils in this place tradition does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
undertake to explain; but assuredly, when we consider the nature
of all public accommodations in that time, we cannot say there is
any decided improbability in the matter. The house appears of
sufficient age for the hypothesis. Perhaps we catch a hint on the
general possibility from a very ancient house farther down the
close, of whose original purpose or owners we know nothing, but
which is adumbrated by this legend:</p>

<p class="center">ANGVSTA AD VSVM AVGVSTA[M]</p>
<p class="center">W F<span class="w12">&nbsp;</span>B G</p>

<p>The Crown Room, however, is elegant enough to have graced
even the presence of Queen Mary, so that she only had not had
to reach it by the Anchor Close. It is handsomely panelled,
with a decorated fireplace, and two tall windows towards the alley.
At present this supposed seat of royal councils, and certain seat
of the social enjoyments of many men of noted talents, forms a
back-shop to Mr Ford, grocer, High Street, and, all dingy and out
of countenance, serves only to store hams, firkins of butter, packages
of groceries, and bundles of dried cod.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The gentle Dawney had an old Gaelic song called Crochallan,
which he occasionally sang to his customers. This led to the
establishment of a club at his house, which, with a reference to
the militia regiments then raising, was called the Crochallan
Corps, or Crochallan Fencibles, and to which belonged, amongst
other men of original character and talent, the well-known
William Smellie, author of the <cite>Philosophy of Natural History</cite>.
Each member bore a military title, and some were endowed with
ideal offices of a ludicrous character: for example, a lately
surviving associate had been <em>depute-hangman</em> to the corps.
Individuals committing a fault were subjected to a mock trial,
in which such members as were barristers could display their
forensic talents to the infinite amusement of the brethren. Much
mirth and not a little horse-play prevailed. Smellie, while
engaged professionally in printing the Edinburgh edition of the
poems of Burns, introduced that genius to the Crochallans,
when a scene of rough banter took place between him and
certain privileged old hands, and the bard declared at the
conclusion that he had ‘never been so abominably thrashed in
his life.’ There was one predominant wit, Willie Dunbar by
name, of whom the poet has left a characteristic picture:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘As I came by Crochallan,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I cannily keekit ben&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Rattling roaring Willie</div>

<div class="verse">Sitting at yon board en’,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Amang gude companie;</div>
<div class="verse">Rattling roaring Willie,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Ye’re welcome hame to me!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He has also described Smellie as coming to Crochallan with
his old cocked hat, gray surtout, and beard rising in its
might:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Yet though his caustic wit was biting, rude,</div>
<div class="verse">His heart was warm, benevolent, and good.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The printing-office of this strange genius being at the bottom of
the close, the transition from the correction of proofs to the
roaring scenes at Crochallan must have been sufficiently easy for
Burns.</p>

</div>

<p>I am indebted to a privately printed memoir on the Anchor
Close for the following anecdote of Crochallan: ‘A comical
gentleman, one of the members of the corps [old Williamson of
Cardrona, in Peeblesshire], got rather tipsy one evening after a
severe <em>field-day</em>. When he came to the head of the Anchor
Close, it occurred to him that it was necessary that he should
take possession of the Castle. He accordingly set off for this
purpose. When he got to the outer gate, he demanded immediate
possession of the garrison, to which he said he was entitled.
The sentinel, for a considerable time, laughed at him; he,
however, became so extremely clamorous that the man found it
necessary to apprise the commanding officer, who immediately
came down to inquire into the meaning of such impertinent
conduct. He at once recognised his friend Cardrona, whom he
had left at the festive board of the Crochallan Corps only a few
hours before. Accordingly, humouring him in the conceit, he
said: ‘Certainly you have every right to the command of this
garrison; if you please, I will conduct you to your proper
apartment.’ He accordingly conveyed him to a bedroom in
his house. Cardrona took formal possession of the place, and
immediately afterwards went to bed. His feelings were indescribable
when he looked out of his bedroom window next
morning, and found himself surrounded with soldiers and great
guns. Some time afterwards this story came to the ears of the
Crochallans; and Cardrona said he never afterwards had the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
of a dog, so much did they tease and harass him about his strange
adventure.’</p>

<p>There is a story connected with the air and song of Crochallan
which will tell strangely after these anecdotes. The title is
properly <cite>Cro Chalien</cite>&mdash;that is, ‘Colin’s Cattle.’ According to
Highland tradition, Colin’s wife, dying at an early age, <em>came
back</em>, some months after she had been buried, and was seen
occasionally in the evenings milking her cow as formerly, and
singing this plaintive air. It is curious thus to find Highland
superstition associated with a snug tavern in the Anchor Close
and the convivialities of such men as Burns and Smellie.</p>

<p>enjoyed the highest celebrity
during the latter years
of the past and early years
of the present century. A
great portion of this house
was literally without light,
consisting of a series of
windowless chambers, decreasing
in size till the
last was a mere box, of
irregular oblong figure, jocularly,
but not inappropriately,
designated <em>the Coffin</em>.
Besides these, there were
but two rooms possessing
light, and as that came
from a deep, narrow alley,
it was light little more
than in name. Hither,
nevertheless, did many of
the Parliament House men
come daily for their meridian.
Here nightly assembled
companies of cits, as
well as of men of wit and
of fashion, to spend hours in what may, by comparison, be described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
as gentle conviviality. The place is said to have been
a howff of Fergusson and Burns in succession. Christopher
North somewhere alludes to meetings of his own with Tom
Campbell in that couthy mansion. David Herd, the editor of
the Scottish songs, Mr Cumming of the Lyon Office, and George
Paton the antiquary were regular customers, each seldom allowing
a night to pass without a symposium at Johnie Dowie’s.
Now, these men are all gone; their very habits are becoming
matters of history; while, as for their evening haunt, the place
which knew it once knows it no more, the new access to the
Lawnmarket, by George IV. Bridge, passing over the area where
it stood.</p>

<p><em>Johnie Dowie’s</em> was chiefly celebrated for ale&mdash;<em>Younger’s
Edinburgh ale</em>&mdash;a potent fluid which almost glued the lips of
the drinker together, and of which few, therefore, could despatch
more than a bottle. John, a sleek, quiet-looking man, in a last-century
style of attire, always brought in the liquor himself,
decanted it carefully, drank a glass to the health of the company,
and then retired. His neat, careful management of the
bottle must have entirely met the views of old William Coke,
the Leith bookseller, of whom it is told that if he saw a greenhorn
of a waiter acting in a different manner, he would rush
indignantly up to him, take the ale out of his hands, caress it
tenderly, as if to soothe and put it to rights again, and then
proceed to the business of decanting it himself, saying: ‘You
rascal, is that the way you attend to your business? Sirrah, you
ought to handle a bottle of ale as you would do a new-born
babe!’</p>

<p><em>Dowie’s</em> was also famed for its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits soupers</i>, as one of its
customers has recorded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse indent6">‘’Deed, gif ye please,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Ye may get a bit toasted cheese,</div>
<div class="wideverse">A crumb o’ tripe, ham, dish o’ peas,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent6">The season fitting;</div>
<div class="wideverse">An egg, or, cauler frae the seas,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent6">A fleuk or whiting.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the reckoning came to be paid, John’s duty usually consisted
simply in counting the empty bottles which stood on a
little shelf where he had placed them above the heads of his
customers, and multiplying these by the price of the liquor&mdash;usually
threepence. Studious of decency, he was rigorous as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
hours, and, when pressed for additional supplies of liquor at a
particular time, would say: ‘No, no, gentlemen; it’s past twelve
o’clock, and time to go home.’</p>

<p>Of John’s conscientiousness as to money matters there is
some illustration in the following otherwise trivial anecdote:
David Herd, being one night prevented by slight indisposition
from joining in the malt potations of his friends, called for first
one and then another glass of spirits, which he dissolved, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more
Scotico</i>, in warm water and sugar. When the reckoning came
to be paid, the antiquary was surprised to find the second glass
charged a fraction higher than the first&mdash;as if John had been
resolved to impose a tax upon excess. On inquiring the reason,
however, honest John explained it thus: ‘Whe, sir, ye see, the
first glass was out o’ the auld barrel, and the second was out o’
the new; and as the whisky in the new barrel cost me mair than
the other, whe, sir, I’ve just charged a wee mair for ’t.’ An
ordinary host would have doubtless equalised the price by
raising that of the first glass to a level with the second. It is
gratifying, but, after this anecdote, not surprising, that John
eventually retired with a fortune said to have amounted to six
thousand pounds. He had a son in the army, who attained the
rank of major, and was a respectable officer.</p>

<p>We get an idea of a class of taverns, humbler in their appointments,
but equally comfortable perhaps in their entertainments,
from the description which has been preserved of <em>Mrs Flockhart’s</em>&mdash;otherwise
<em>Lucky Fykie’s</em>&mdash;in the Potterrow. This was a
remarkably small, as well as obscure mansion, bearing externally
the appearance of a huckstry shop. The lady was a neat, little,
thin, elderly woman, usually habited in a plain striped blue
gown, and apron of the same stuff, with a black ribbon round
her head and lappets tied under her chin. She was far from
being poor in circumstances, as her husband, the umquhile
John Flucker, or Flockhart, had left her some ready money,
together with his whole stock-in-trade, consisting of a multifarious
variety of articles&mdash;as ropes, tea, sugar, whip-shafts,
porter, ale, beer, yellow sand, <em>calm-stane</em>, herrings, nails, cotton-wicks,
stationery, thread, needles, tapes, potatoes, lollipops,
onions, matches, &amp;c., constituting her a very respectable <em>merchant</em>,
as the phrase was understood in Scotland. On Sundays, too,
Mrs Flockhart’s little visage might have been seen in a front-gallery
seat in Mr Pattieson’s chapel in the Potterrow. Her
abode, situated opposite to Chalmers’s Entry in that suburban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
thoroughfare, was a square of about fifteen feet each way, divided
agreeably to the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figcenter w450">
<img src="images/illus_p_169.jpg" width="450" height="363" alt="Plan" />
</div>

<p>Each forenoon was this place, or at least all in front of the
screen, put into the neatest order; at the same time three
bottles, severally containing brandy, rum, and whisky, were
placed on a bunker-seat in the window of the ‘hotel,’ flanked
by a few glasses and a salver of gingerbread biscuits. About
noon any one watching the place from an opposite window
would have observed an elderly gentleman entering the humble
shop, where he saluted the lady with a ‘Hoo d’ye do, mem?’
and then passed into the side space to indulge himself with a
glass from one or other of the bottles. After him came another,
who went through the same ceremonial; after him another
again; and so on. Strange to say, these were men of importance
in society&mdash;some of them lawyers in good employment, some
bankers, and so forth, and all of them inhabitants of good houses
in George Square. It was in passing to or from forenoon
business in town that they thus regaled themselves. On special
occasions Lucky could furnish forth a <em>soss</em>&mdash;that is, stew&mdash;which
the votary might partake of upon a clean napkin in the closet,
a place which only admitted of one chair being placed in it.
Such were amongst the habits of the fathers of some of our
present (1824) most distinguished citizens!</p>

<p>This may be the proper place for introducing the few notices
which I have collected respecting Edinburgh inns of a past date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p>The oldest house known to have been used in the character
of an inn is one situated in what is called Davidson’s or the
White Horse Close, at the bottom of the Canongate. A sort of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> gives access to a court having mean buildings on
either hand, but facing us a goodly structure of antique fashion,
having two outside stairs curiously arranged, and the whole
reminding us much of certain houses still numerous in the
Netherlands. A date, deficient in the decimal figure (16-3),
gives us assurance of the seventeenth century, and, judging from
the style of the building, I would say the house belongs to an
early portion of that age. The whole of the ground-floor, accessible
from the street called North Back of Canongate, has been
used as stables, thus reminding us of the absence of nicety in a
former age, when human beings were content to sit with only a
wooden floor between themselves and their horses.</p>

<p>This house, supposed to have been styled <em>The White Horse
Inn</em> or <em>White Horse Stables</em> (for the latter was the more common
word), would be conveniently situated for persons travelling to
or arriving from London, as it is close to the ancient exit of the
town in that direction. The adjacent Water-gate took its name
from a horse-pond, which probably was an appendage of this
mansion. The manner of procedure for a gentleman going to
London in the days of the <em>White Horse</em> was to come booted to
this house with saddle-bags, and here engage and mount a
suitable roadster, which was to serve all the way. In 1639,
when Charles I. had made his first pacification with the
Covenanters, and had come temporarily to Berwick, he sent
messages to the chief lords of that party, desiring some conversation
with them. They were unsuspectingly mounting their
horses at this inn, in order to ride to Berwick, when a mob,
taught by the clergy to suspect that the king wished only to wile
over the nobles to his side, came and forcibly prevented them
from commencing their designed journey. Montrose alone
broke through this restraint; and assuredly the result in his
instance was such as to give some countenance to the suspicion,
as thenceforward he was a royalist in his heart.</p>

<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_170">Page 170.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <em>White Horse</em> has ceased to be an inn from a time which
no ‘oldest inhabitant’ of my era could pretend to have any
recollection of. The only remaining fact of interest connected
with it is one concerning Dr Alexander Rose, the last Bishop
of Edinburgh, and the last survivor of the established Episcopacy
of Scotland. Bishop Keith, who had been one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
presbyters, and describes him as a sweet-natured man, of a
venerable aspect, states that he died March 20, 1720, ‘in his
own sister’s house in the Canongate, in which street he also
lived.’ Tradition points to the floor immediately above the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> by which the stable-yard is entered from the street
as the humble mansion in which the bishop breathed his last.
I know at least one person who never goes past the place
without an emotion of respect, remembering the self-abandoning
devotion of the Scottish prelates to their engagements at the
Revolution:<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Amongst the faithless, faithful only found.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To the elegant accommodations of the best New Town establishments
of the present day, the inns of the last century present a
contrast which it is difficult by the greatest stretch of imagination
to realise. For the west road, there was the <em>White Hart</em> in the
Grassmarket; for the east, the <em>White Horse Inn</em> in Boyd’s Close,
Canongate; for the south, and partly also the east, Peter Ramsay’s,
at the bottom of St Mary’s Wynd. Arnot, writing in 1779,
describes them as ‘mean buildings; their apartments dirty and
dismal; and if the waiters happen to be out of the way, a stranger
will perhaps be shocked with the novelty of being shown into a
room by a dirty, sunburnt wench, without shoes or stockings.’
The fact is, however, these houses were mainly used as places for
keeping horses. Guests, unless of a very temporary character, were
usually relegated to lodging-houses, of which there were several
on a considerable scale&mdash;as Mrs Thomson’s at the Cross, who
advertises, in 1754, that persons not bringing ‘their silver plate,
tea china, table china, and tea linen, can be served in them all;’
also in wines and spirits; likewise that persons boarding with
her ‘may expect everything in a very genteel manner.’ But
hear the unflattering Arnot on these houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span> ‘He [the stranger]
is probably conducted to the third or fourth floor, up dark
and dirty stairs, and there shown into apartments meanly
fitted up and poorly furnished.... In Edinburgh, letting of
lodgings is a business by itself, and thereby the prices are very
extravagant; and every article of furniture, far from wearing the
appearance of having been purchased for a happy owner, seems
to be scraped together with a penurious hand, to pass muster
before a stranger who will never wish to return!’</p>

<p><em>Ramsay’s</em> was almost solely a place of stables. General
Paoli,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on visiting Edinburgh in 1771, came to this house, but
was immediately taken home by his friend Boswell to James’s
Court, where he lived during his stay in our city; his companion,
the Polish ambassador, being accommodated with a bed by Dr
John Gregory, in a neighbouring floor. An old gentleman of my
acquaintance used to talk of having seen the Duke of Hamilton
one day lounging in front of Ramsay’s inn, occasionally chatting
with any gay or noble friend who passed. To one knowing
the Edinburgh of the present day, nothing could seem more
extravagant than the idea of such company at such places. I
nevertheless find Ramsay, in 1776, advertising that, exclusive
of some part of his premises recently offered for sale, he is
‘possessed of a good house of entertainment, good stables for
above one hundred horses, and sheds for above twenty carriages.’
He retired from business about 1790 with £10,000.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The modern <em>White Horse</em> was a place of larger and somewhat
better accommodations, though still far from an equality
with even the second-rate houses of the present day. Here
also the rooms were directly over the stables.</p>

<p>It was almost a matter of course that Dr Johnson, on arriving
in Edinburgh, August 17, 1773, should have come to the <em>White
Horse</em>, which was then kept by a person of the name of Boyd.
His note to Boswell informing him of this fact was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
‘<em>Saturday night.</em>
</p>

<p>‘Mr Johnson sends his compliments to Mr Boswell, being just arrived at
Boyd’s.’</p></div>

<p>When Boswell came, he found his illustrious friend in a violent
passion at the waiter for having sweetened his lemonade without
the ceremony of a pair of sugar-tongs. Mr William Scott,
afterwards Lord Stowell, accompanied Johnson on this occasion;
and he informs us, in a note to Croker’s edition of Boswell,
that when he heard the mistress of the house styled, in Scotch
fashion, <em>Lucky</em>, which he did not then understand, he thought
she should rather have been styled <em>Unlucky</em>, for the doctor
seemed as if he would destroy the house.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span></p>
<p>James Boyd, the keeper of this inn, was addicted to horse-racing,
and his victories on the turf, or rather on Leith sands,
are frequently chronicled in the journals of that day. It is said
that he was at one time on the brink of ruin, when he was
saved by a lucky run with a white horse, which, in gratitude, he
kept idle all the rest of its days, besides setting up its portrait
as his sign. He eventually retired from this ‘dirty and dismal’
inn with a fortune of several thousand pounds; and, as a
curious note upon the impression which its slovenliness conveyed
to Dr Johnson, it may be stated as a fact, well authenticated,
that at the time of his giving up the house he possessed
<em>napery</em> to the value of five hundred pounds!</p>

<p>A large room in the <em>White Horse</em> was the frequent scene of
the marriages of runaway English couples, at a time when these
irregularities were permitted in Edinburgh. On one of the
windows were scratched the words:</p>

<p class="center">
‘JEREMIAH and SARAH BENTHAM, 1768.’
</p>

<p>Could this be the distinguished jurist and codificator, on a
journey to Scotland in company with a female relation?<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_CROSS_CADDIES" id="THE_CROSS_CADDIES">THE CROSS&mdash;CADDIES.</a></h2>


<p>The Cross, a handsome octagonal building in the High Street,
surmounted by a pillar bearing the Scottish unicorn, was the
great centre of gossip in former days. The principal coffee-houses
and booksellers’ shops were close to this spot. The
chief merchants, the leading official persons, the men of learning
and talents, the laird, the noble, the clergyman, were constantly
clustering hereabouts during certain hours of the day. It was
the very centre and cynosure of the old city.</p>

<p>During the reigns of the first and second Georges, it was
customary for the magistrates of Edinburgh to drink the king’s
health on his birthday on a stage erected at the Cross&mdash;loyalty
being a virtue which always becomes peculiarly ostentatious
when it is under any suspicion of weakness. On one of these
occasions the ceremony was interrupted by a shower of rain, so
heavy that the company, with one consent, suddenly dispersed,
leaving their entertainment half-finished. When they returned,
the glasses were found full of water, which gave a Jacobite lady
occasion for the following epigram, reported to me by a venerable
bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘In Cana once Heaven’s king was pleased</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With some gay bridal folks to dine,</div>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_174">Page 174.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>As the place where state proclamations were always made,
where the execution of noted state criminals took place, and
where many important public ceremonials were enacted, the
Cross of Edinburgh is invested with numberless associations of
a most interesting kind, extending over several centuries. Here
took place the mysterious midnight proclamation, summoning
the Flodden lords to the domains of Pluto, as described so
strikingly in <cite>Marmion</cite>; the witness being ‘Mr Richard Lawson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
ill-disposed, ganging in his gallery fore-stair.’ Here did King
James VI. bring together his barbarous nobles, and make them
shake hands over a feast partaken of before the eyes of the
people. Here did the Covenanting lords read their protests
against Charles’s feeble proclamations. Here fell Montrose,
Huntly, the Argylls, Warriston, and many others of note, victims
of political dissension. Here were fountains set a-flowing with
the blood-red wine, to celebrate the passing of kings along the
causeway. And here, as a last notable fact, were Prince Charles
and his father proclaimed by their devoted Highlanders, amidst
screams of pipe and blare of trumpet, while the beautiful Mrs
Murray of Broughton sat beside the party on horseback, adorned
with white ribbons, and with a drawn sword in her hand! How
strange it seems that a time should at length have come when a
set of magistrates thought this structure an encumbrance to the
street, and had it removed. This event took place in 1756&mdash;the
ornamental stones dispersed, the pillar taken to the park
at Drum.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The Cross was the peculiar citadel and rallying-point of a
species of lazzaroni called <em>Caddies</em> or <em>Cawdies</em>, which formerly
existed in Edinburgh, employing themselves chiefly as street-messengers
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valets de place</i>. A ragged, half-blackguard-looking
set they were, but allowed to be amazingly acute and
intelligent, and also faithful to any duty entrusted to them. A
stranger coming to reside temporarily in Edinburgh got a caddy
attached to his service to conduct him from one part of the town
to another, to run errands for him; in short, to be wholly at his
bidding.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse indent2">‘Omnia novit,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Græculus esuriens, in cœlum, jusseris, ibit.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A caddy <em>did</em> literally know everything&mdash;of Edinburgh; even to
that kind of knowledge which we now only expect in a street
directory. And it was equally true that he could hardly be asked
to go anywhere, or upon any mission, that he would not go. On
the other hand, the stranger would probably be astonished to find
that, in a few hours, his caddy was acquainted with every particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
regarding himself, where he was from, what was his purpose
in Edinburgh, his family connections, and his own tastes and
dispositions. Of course for every particle of scandal floating about
Edinburgh, the caddy was a ready book of reference. We sometimes
wonder how our ancestors did without newspapers. We
do not reflect on the living vehicles of news which then existed:
the privileged beggar for the country people; for townsfolk, the
caddies.</p>

<p>The caddy is alluded to as a useful kind of blackguard in Burt’s
<cite>Letters from the North of Scotland</cite>, written about 1740. He says
that although they are mere wretches in rags, lying upon stairs
and in the streets at night, they are often considerably trusted,
and seldom or never prove unfaithful. The story told by tradition
is that they formed a society under a chief called their
constable, with a common fund or box; that when they committed
any misdemeanour, such as incivility or lying, they were punished
by this officer by fines, or sometimes corporeally; and if by any
chance money entrusted to them should not be forthcoming, it
was made up out of the common treasury. Mr Burt says:
‘Whether it be true or not I cannot say, but I have been told
by several that one of the judges formerly abandoned two of
his sons for a time to this way of life, as believing it would
create in them a sharpness which might be of use to them in
the future course of their lives.’ Major Topham, describing
Edinburgh in 1774, says of the caddies: ‘In short, they are the
tutelary guardians of the city; and it is entirely owing to them
that there are fewer robberies and less housebreaking in Edinburgh
than anywhere else.’</p>

<p>Another conspicuous set of public servants characteristic of Edinburgh
in past times were the <em>Chairmen</em>, or carriers of sedans, who
also formed a society among themselves, but were of superior respectability,
in as far as none but steady, considerate persons of so
humble an order could become possessed of the means to buy the
vehicle by which they made their bread. In former times, when
Edinburgh was so much more limited than now, and rather an
assemblage of alleys than of streets, sedans were in comparatively
great request. They were especially in requisition amongst the
ladies&mdash;indeed, almost exclusively so. From time immemorial the
sons of the Gael have monopolised this branch of service; and as
far as the business of a sedan-carrier can yet be said to exist
amongst us, it is in the possession of Highlanders.</p>

<p>The reader must not be in too great haste to smile when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
claim his regard for an historical person among the chairmen of
Edinburgh. This was Edward Burke, the immediate attendant
of Prince Charles Edward during the earlier portion of his wanderings
in the Highlands. Honest Ned had been a chairman in our
city, but attaching himself as a servant to Mr Alexander Macleod
of Muiravonside, aide-de-camp to the Prince, it was his fortune to
be present at the battle of Culloden, and to fly from the field in
his Royal Highness’s company. He attended the Prince for
several weeks, sharing cheerfully in all his hardships, and doing
his best to promote his escape. Thus has his name been inseparably
associated with this remarkable chapter of history. After
parting with Charles, this poor man underwent some dreadful
hardships while under hiding, his fears of being taken having
reference chiefly to the Prince, as he was apprehensive that the
enemy might torture him to gain intelligence of his late master’s
movements. At length the Act of Indemnity placed him at his
ease; and the humble creature who, by a word of his mouth,
might have gained thirty thousand pounds, quietly returned to
his duty as a chairman on the streets of Edinburgh! Which
of the venal train of Walpole, which even of the admirers of
Pulteney, is more entitled to admiration than Ned Burke? A
man, too, who could neither read nor write&mdash;for such was actually
his case.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>One cannot but feel it to be in some small degree a consolatory
circumstance, and not without a certain air of the romance of an
earlier day, that a bacchanal company came with a bowl of
punch, the night before the demolition, and in that mood of mind
when men shed ‘smiles that might as well be tears,’ drank the
Dredgie of the Cross upon its doomed battlements.</p>

<p>One of the characteristic features of Edinburgh in old times
was its Town-guard, a body of military in the service of the
magistrates for the purposes of a police, but dressed and armed
in all respects as soldiers. Composed for the most part of old
Highlanders, of uncouth aspect and speech, dressed in a dingy
red uniform with cocked hats, and often exchanging the musket
for an antique native weapon called the Lochaber axe, these men
were (at least in latter times) an unfailing subject of mirth to the
citizens, particularly the younger ones. In my recollection they
had a sort of Patmos in the ground-floor of the Old Tolbooth,
where a few of them might constantly be seen on duty, endeavouring
to look as formidable as possible to the little boys who might
be passing by. On such occasions as executions, or races at Leith,
or the meeting of the General Assembly, they rose into a certain
degree of consequence; but in general they could hardly be
considered as of any practical utility. Their numbers were at that
time much reduced&mdash;only twenty-five privates, two sergeants, two
corporals, and a couple of drummers. Every night did their
drum beat through the Old Town at eight o’clock, as a kind of
curfew. No other drum, it seems, was allowed to sound on the
High Street between the Luckenbooths and Netherbow. They
also had an old practice of giving a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">charivari</i> on the drum on
the night of a marriage before the lodgings of the bridegroom;
of course not without the expectation of something wherewithal to
drink the health of the young couple. A strange remnant of old
times altogether were the <em>Town Rats</em>, as the poor old fellows
were disrespectfully called by the boys, in allusion to the hue of
their uniform.</p>

<p>Previous to 1805, when an unarmed police was established for
the protection of the streets, the Town-guard had consisted of
three equally large companies, each with a lieutenant (complimentarily
called captain) at its head. Then it was a somewhat more
respectable body, not only as being larger, but invested with a
really useful purpose. The unruly and the vicious stood in some
awe of a troop of men bearing lethal weapons, and generally
somewhat frank in the use of them. If sometimes roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
handled on kings’ birthdays and other exciting occasions, they
in their turn did not fail to treat cavalierly enough any unfortunate
roisterer whom they might find breaking the peace. They
had, previous to 1785, a guard-house in the middle of the High
Street, the ‘black hole’ of which had rather a bad character
among the bucks and the frail ladies. One of their sergeants
in those days, by name John Dhu, is commemorated by Scott as
the fiercest-looking fellow he ever saw. If we might judge from
poor Robert Fergusson, they were truly formidable in his time.
He says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse">‘And thou, great god o’ aquavitæ,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Wha sway’st the empire o’ this city; ...</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">Be thou prepared</div>
<div class="wideverse">To hedge us frae that <em>black banditti</em>,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">The City-guard.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He adds, apostrophising the irascible veterans:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse">‘Oh, soldiers, for your ain dear sakes,</div>
<div class="wideverse">For Scotland’s love&mdash;the land o’ cakes&mdash;</div>

<div class="wideverse indent4">Nor be sae rude,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Wi’ firelock and Lochaber axe,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">As spill their blude!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The affair at the execution of Wilson the smuggler in 1736,
when, under command of Porteous, they fired upon and killed
many of the mob, may be regarded as a peculiarly impressive
example of the stern relation in which they stood to the populace
of a former age.</p>

<p>The great bulk of the corps was drawn either from the Highlands
directly or from the Highland regiments. A humble
Highlander considered it as getting a <em>berth</em> when he was enlisted
into the Edinburgh Guard. Of this feeling we have a remarkable
illustration in an anecdote which I was told by the late Mr Alexander
Campbell regarding the Highland bard, Duncan Macintyre,
usually called <em>Donacha Bhan</em>. This man, really an exquisite poet
to those understanding his language, became the object of a kind
interest to many educated persons in Perthshire, his native county.
The Earl of Breadalbane sent to let him know that he wished to
befriend him, and was anxious to procure him some situation that
might put him comparatively at his ease. Poor Duncan returned
his thanks, and asked his lordship’s interest&mdash;to get him into the
Edinburgh Town-guard&mdash;pay, sixpence a day! What sort of
material these men would have proved in the hands of the magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
if Provost Stewart had attempted by their means and the
other forces at his command to hold out the city against Prince
Charlie seems hardly to be matter of doubt. I was told the
following anecdote of a member of the corps, on good authority.
Robert Stewart, a descendant of the Stewarts of Bonskeid in
Athole, was then a private in the City-guard. When General
Hawley left Edinburgh to meet the Highland army in the west
country, Stewart had just been relieved from duty for the customary
period of two days. Instantly forming his plan of action,
he set off with his gun, passed through the English troops on
their march, and joined those of the Prince. Stewart fought next
day like a hero in the battle of Falkirk, where the Prince had the
best of it; and next morning our Town-guardsman was back to
Edinburgh in time to go upon duty at the proper hour. The
captain of his company suspected what business Robert and his
gun had been engaged in, but preserved a friendly silence.</p>

<p>The <em>Gutter-blood</em> people of Edinburgh had an extravagant idea
of the antiquity of the Guard, led probably by a fallacy arising
from the antiquity of the individual men. They used to have a
strange story&mdash;too ridiculous, one would have thought, for a
moment’s credence anywhere&mdash;that the Town-guard existed before
the Christian era. When the Romans invaded Britain, some of
the Town-guard joined them; and three were actually present in
Pilate’s guard at the Crucifixion! In reality, the corps took its
rise in the difficulties brought on by bad government in 1682,
when, at the instigation of the Duke of York, it was found
necessary to raise a body of 108 armed men, under a trusty
commander, simply to keep the people in check.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Fifty years ago (1824) the so-called captaincies of the Guard
were snug appointments, in great request among respectable old
citizens who had not succeeded in business. Kay has given us
some illustrations of these extraordinary specimens of soldier-craft,
one of whom was nineteen stone. Captain Gordon of
Gordonstown, representative of one of the oldest families in
Scotland, found himself obliged by fortune to accept of one of
these situations.</p>

<p>Scott, writing his <cite>Heart of Mid-Lothian</cite> in 1817, says: ‘Of
late, the gradual diminution of these civic soldiers reminds one
of the abatement of King Lear’s hundred knights. The edicts of
each set of succeeding magistrates have, like those of Goneril
and Regan, diminished this venerable band with similar question&mdash;“What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
need have we of five-and-twenty?&mdash;ten?&mdash;five?” and
now it is nearly come to: “What need we one?” A spectre may
indeed here and there still be seen of an old gray-headed and
gray-bearded Highlander, with war-worn features, but bent double
by age; dressed in an old-fashioned cocked-hat, bound with white
tape instead of silver lace, and in coat, waistcoat, and breeches
of a muddy-coloured red; bearing in his withered hand an ancient
weapon, called a Lochaber axe&mdash;a long pole, namely, with an axe
at the extremity, and a hook at the back of the hatchet. Such a
phantom of former days still creeps, I have been informed, round
the statue of Charles II. in the Parliament Square, as if the image
of a Stuart were the last refuge for any memorial of our ancient
manners,’ &amp;c. At the close of this very year, the ‘What need
we one?’ was asked, and answered in the negative; and the corps
was accordingly dissolved. ‘Their last march to do duty at
Hallow Fair had something in it affecting. Their drums and
fifes had been wont, in better days, to play on this joyous occasion
the lively tune of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Jockey to the fair;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but on this final occasion the afflicted veterans moved slowly to
the dirge of</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The half-serious pathos of Scott regarding this corps becomes
wholly so when we learn that a couple of members survived to
make an actual last public appearance in the procession which
consecrated his richly deserved monument, August 15, 1846.</p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>The Blue Blanket&mdash;Mobs of the Seventeenth Century&mdash;Bowed
Joseph.</strong></p>


<p>The Edinburgh populace was noted, during many ages, for its
readiness to rise in tumultuary fashion, whether under the
prompting of religious zeal or from inferior motives. At an early
time they became an impromptu army, each citizen possessing
weapons which he was ready and willing to use. Thus they are
understood to have risen in 1482 to redeem James III. from
restraint in the Castle; for which service, besides certain privileges,
‘he granted them,’ says Maitland, ‘a banner or standard, with a
power to display the same in defence of their king, country, and
their own right.’ The historian adds: ‘This flag, at present
denominated the <span class="smcap">Blue Blanket</span>, is kept by the Convener of the
Trades; at whose appearance therewith, ’tis said that not only
the artificers of Edinburgh are obliged to repair to it, but all the
artisans or craftsmen within Scotland are bound to follow it, and
fight under the Convener of Edinburgh, as aforesaid.’ The Blue
Blanket, I may mention, has become a sort of myth in Edinburgh,
being magnified by the popular imagination into a banner which
the citizens carried with them to the Holy Land in one of the
Crusades&mdash;expeditions which took place before Edinburgh had
become a town fit to furnish any distinct corps of armed men.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>When the Protestant faith came to stir up men’s minds,
the lower order of citizens became a formidable body indeed.
James VI., who had more than once experienced their violence,
and consequently knew them well, says very naïvely in his <cite>Basilicon
Doron</cite>, or ‘Book of Instruction’ to his son: ‘They think we
should be content with their work, how bad and dear soever it be;
and if they be in anything controuled, up goeth the <em>Blue Blanket</em>!’</p>

<p>The tumults at the introduction of the Service-book, in 1637,
need only be alluded to. So late as the Revolution there appears
a military spirit of great boldness in the Edinburgh populace,
reminding us of that of Paris in our own times: witness the bloody
contests which took place in accomplishing the destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
papistical arrangements at the Abbey, December 1688. The
Union mobs were of unexampled violence; and Edinburgh was
only kept in some degree of quiet, during the greater part of that
crisis, by a great assemblage of troops. Finally, in the Porteous
mob we have a singular example of popular vengeance, wreaked
out in the most cool but determined manner. Men seem to have
been habitually under an impression in those days that the law
was at once an imperfect and a partial power. They seem to have
felt themselves constantly liable to be called upon to supplement
its energy, or control or compensate for its errors. The mob had
at that time a part in the state.</p>

<div class="figcenter w150">
<img src="images/illus_p_184.jpg" width="150" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">‘General’ Joe Smith
laying down the Law
to the Magistrates.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this ‘fierce democracy’ there once arose a mighty Pyrrhus,
who contrived, by dint of popular qualifications, to subject the
rabble to his command, and to get himself elected, by acclamation,
dictator of all its motions and exploits. How he acquired his
wonderful power is not recorded; but it is to be supposed that
his activity on occasions of mobbing, his boldness and sagacity, his
strong voice and uncommonly powerful whistle, together with the
mere whim or humour of the thing, conspired to his promotion.
His trade was that of a cobbler, and he
resided in some obscure den in the Cowgate.
His person was low and deformed, with the
sole good property of great muscular strength
in the arms. Yet this wretch, miserable and
contemptible as he appeared, might be said
to have had at one time the command of the
Scottish metropolis. The magistrates, it is
true, assembled every Wednesday forenoon
to manage the affairs and deliberate upon
the improvements of the city; but their
power was merely that of a viceroyalty.
<em>Bowed Joseph</em>, otherwise called General Joseph
Smith, was the only true potentate; and
their resolutions could only be carried into
effect when not inconsistent with his views of
policy.</p>

<p>In exercising the functions of his perilous
office, it does not appear that he ever drew
down the vengeance of the more lawfully constituted
authorities of the land. On the
contrary, he was in some degree countenanced by the magistracy,
who, however, patronised him rather from fear than respect. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
frequently sent for him in emergencies, in order to consult with him
regarding the best means of appeasing and dispersing the mob.
On such occasions nothing could equal the consequential air which
he assumed. With one hand stuck carelessly into his side, and
another slapped resolutely down upon the table&mdash;with a majestic
toss of the head, and as much fierceness in his little gray eye as if
he were himself a mob&mdash;he would stand before the anxious and
feeble council, pleading the cause of his compeers, and suggesting
the best means of assuaging their just fury. He was generally
despatched with a promise of amendment and a hogshead of good
ale, with which he could easily succeed in appeasing his men, whose
dismissal, after a speech from himself and a libation from the
barrel, was usually accomplished by the simple words: ‘<em>Now
disperse, my lads!</em>’</p>

<p>Joseph was not only employed in directing and managing the
mobs, but frequently performed exploits without the co-operation
of his greasy friends, though always for their amusement and in
their behalf. Thus, for instance, when Wilkes by his celebrated
Number 45 incensed the Scottish nation so generally and so
bitterly, Joseph got a cart, fitted up with a high gallows, from
which depended a straw-stuffed effigy of North Britain’s arch-enemy,
with the devil perched upon his shoulder; and this he
paraded through the streets, followed by the multitude, till he
came to the Gallow Lee in Leith Walk, where two criminals
were then hanging in chains, beside whom he exposed the figures
of Wilkes and his companion. Thus also, when the Douglas cause
was decided against the popular opinion in the Court of Session,
Joseph went up to the chair of the Lord President as he was
going home to his house, and called him to account for the
injustice of his decision. After the said decision was reversed by
the House of Lords, Joseph, by way of triumph over the Scottish
court, dressed up fifteen figures in rags and wigs, resembling the
judicial attire, mounted them on asses, and led them through the
streets, telling the populace that they saw the fifteen senators of
the College of Justice!</p>

<p>When the craft of shoemakers used, in former times, to parade
the High Street, West Bow, and Grassmarket, with inverted tin
kettles on their heads and schoolboys’ rulers in their hands,
Joseph&mdash;who, though a leader and commander on every other
public occasion, was not admitted into this procession on account
of his being only a cobbler&mdash;dressed himself in his best clothes,
with a royal crown painted and gilt and a wooden truncheon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
marched pompously through the city till he came to the Netherbow,
where he planted himself in the middle of the street to
await the approach of the procession, which he, as a citizen of
Edinburgh, proposed to welcome into the town. When the royal
shoemaker came to the Netherbow Port, Joseph stood forth,
removed the truncheon from his haunch, flourished it in the air,
and pointing it to the ground, with much dignity of manner,
addressed his paste-work majesty in these words: ‘O great King
Crispianus! what are we in thy sight but a parcel of puir slaister-kytes&mdash;creeshy
cobblers&mdash;sons of bitches?’ And I have been
assured that this ceremony was performed in a style of burlesque
exhibiting no small artistic power.</p>

<p>Joseph had a wife, whom he would never permit to walk beside
him, it being his opinion that women are inferior to the male part
of creation, and not entitled to the same privileges. He compelled
his spouse to walk a few paces behind him; and when he turned,
she was obliged to make a circuit so as to maintain the precise
distance from his person which he assigned to her. When he
wished to say anything to her, he whistled as upon a dog, upon
which she came up to him submissively and heard what he had to
say; after which she respectfully resumed her station in the rear.</p>

<p>After he had figured for a few years as an active partisan of the
people, his name waxed of such account with them that it is said
he could in the course of an hour collect a crowd of not fewer
than ten thousand persons, all ready to obey his high behests, or
to disperse at his bidding. In collecting his troops he employed
a drum, which, though a general, he did not disdain to beat with
his own hands; and never, surely, had the fiery cross of the
Highland chief such an effect upon the warlike devotion of his
clan as Bowed Joseph’s drum had upon the spirit of the Edinburgh
rabble. As he strode along, the street was cleared of its loungers,
every close pouring forth an addition to his train, like the
populous glens adjacent to a large Highland strath giving forth
their accessions to the general force collected by the aforesaid
cross. The Town Rats, who might peep forth like old cautious
snails on hearing his drum, would draw in their horns with a
Gaelic execration, and shut their door, as he approached; while
the <em>Lazy Corner</em> was, at sight of him, a lazy corner no longer;
and the West Bow ceased to resound as he descended.</p>

<p>It would appear, after all, that there was a moral foundation
for Joseph’s power, as there must be for that of all governments
of a more regular nature that would wish to thrive or be lasting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
The little man was never known to act in a bad cause, or in any
way to go against the principles of natural justice. He employed
his power in the redress of such grievances as the law of the land
does not or cannot easily reach; and it was apparent that almost
everything he did was for the sake of what he himself designated
<em>fair-play</em>. Fair-play, indeed, was his constant object, whether in
clearing room with his brawny arms for a boxing-match, insulting
the constituted authorities, sacking the granary of a monopolist,
or besieging the Town-council in their chamber.</p>

<p>An anecdote which proves this strong love of fair-play deserves
to be recorded. A poor man in the Pleasance having been a
little deficient in his rent, and in the country on business, his
landlord seized and rouped his household furniture, turning out
the family to the street. On the poor man’s return, finding the
house desolate and his family in misery, he went to a neighbouring
stable and hanged himself.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Bowed Joseph did not long remain
ignorant of the case; and as soon as it was generally known in the
city, he shouldered on his drum, and after beating it through the
streets for half-an-hour, found himself followed by several thousand
persons, inflamed with resentment at the landlord’s cruelty. With
this army he marched to an open space of ground now covered
by Adam Street, Roxburgh Street, &amp;c., named in former times
Thomson’s Park, where, mounted upon the shoulders of six of his
lieutenant-generals, he proceeded to harangue them, in Cambyses’s
vein, concerning the flagrant oppression which they were about to
revenge. He concluded by directing his men to sack the premises
of the cruel landlord, who by this time had wisely made his
escape; and this order was instantly obeyed. Every article which
the house contained was brought out to the street, where, being
piled up in a heap, the general set fire to them with his own hand,
while the crowd rent the air with their acclamations. Some
money and bank-notes perished in the blaze, besides an eight-day
clock, which, sensible to the last, calmly struck ten just as it was
consigned to the flames.</p>

<p>On another occasion, during a scarcity, the mob, headed by
Joseph, had compelled all the meal-dealers to sell their meal at a
certain price per peck, under penalty of being obliged to shut up
their shops. One of them, whose place of business was in the
Grassmarket, agreed to sell his meal at the price fixed by the
general, for the good of the poor, as he said; and he did so under
the superintendence of Joseph, who stationed a party at the shop-door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
to preserve peace and good order till the whole stock was
disposed of, when, by their leader’s command, the mob gave three
hearty cheers, and quietly dispersed. Next day, the unlucky victualler
let his friends know that he had not suffered so much by
this compulsory trade as might be supposed; because, though the
price was below that of the market, he had taken care to use a
measure which gave only about three-fourths instead of the whole.
It was not long ere this intelligence came to the ears of our tribune,
who, immediately collecting a party of his troops, beset the meal-dealer
before he was aware, and compelled him to pay back a
fourth of the price of every peck of meal sold; then giving their
victim a hearty drubbing, they sacked his shop, and quietly
dispersed as before.</p>

<p>Some foreign princes happening to visit Edinburgh during
Joseph’s administration, at a period of the year when the mob of
Edinburgh was wont to amuse itself with an annual burning of
the pope, the magistrates felt anxious that this ceremony should
for once be dispensed with, as it might hurt the feelings of their
distinguished visitors. The provost, in this emergency, resolved
not to employ his own authority, but that of Joseph, to whom,
accordingly, he despatched his compliments, with half a guinea,
begging his kind offices in dissuading the mob from the performance
of their accustomed sport. Joseph received the message with
the respect due to the commission of ‘his friend the Lord Provost,’
and pocketed the half-guinea with a complacent smile; but
standing up to his full height, and resolutely shaking his rough
head, he gave for answer that ‘he was highly gratified by his
lordship’s message; but, everything considered, the pope <em>must be
burnt</em>!’ And so the pope, honest man, <em>was</em> burnt with all the
honours accordingly.</p>

<p>Joseph was at last killed by a fall from the top of a Leith
stage-coach, in returning from the races, while in a state of
intoxication, about the year 1780. It is to be hoped, for the
good of society, that ‘we ne’er shall look upon his like again.’<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<h2><a name="BICKERS" id="BICKERS">BICKERS.</a></h2>


<p>Amongst the social features of a bygone age in Edinburgh
were the <em>bickers</em> in which the boys were wont to indulge&mdash;that
is, street conflicts, conducted chiefly with stones, though
occasionally with sticks also, and even more formidable weapons.
One cannot but wonder that, so lately as the period when elderly
men now living were boys, the powers for preserving peace in the
city should have been so weak as to allow of such battles taking
place once or twice almost every week. The practice was, however,
only of a piece with the general rudeness of those old days;
and, after all, there was more appearance than reality of danger
attending it. It was truly, as one who had borne a part in it has
remarked, ‘only a rough kind of play.’<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The most likely time for a bicker was Saturday afternoon, when
the schools and hospitals held no restraint over their tenants.
Then it was almost certain that either the Old Town and New
Town boys, the George Square and Potterrow boys, the Herioters
and the Watsoners, or some other parties accustomed to regard
themselves as natural enemies, would meet on some common
ground, and fall a-pelting each other. There were hardly anywhere
two adjoining streets but the boys respectively belonging
to them would occasionally hold encounters of this kind; and the
animosity assumed a darker tinge if there was any discrepancy of
rank or condition between the parties, as was apt to be the case
when, for instance, the Old Town lads met the children of the
aristocratic streets to the north. Older people looked on with
anxiety, and wondered what the Town-guard was about, and
occasionally reports were heard that such a boy had got a wound
in the head, while another had lost a couple of his front teeth; it
was even said that fatal cases had occurred in the memory of aged
citizens. Yet, to the best of my recollection&mdash;for I do remember
something of bickers&mdash;there was little likelihood of severe damage.
The parties somehow always kept at a good distance from each
other, and there was a perpetual running in one direction or
another; certainly nothing like hand-to-hand fighting. Occasionally
attempts were made to put down the riot, but seldom with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
much success; for it was one of the most ludicrous features of
these contests that whenever the Town-guard made its appearance
on the ground, the belligerent powers instantly coalesced against
the common foe. Besides, they could quickly make their way to
other ground, and there continue the war.</p>

<p>Bickers must have had a foundation in human nature: from no
temporary effervescence of the boy-mind did they spring; pleasant,
though wrong, had they been from all time. Witness the following
act of the Town-council so long ago as 1529: ‘<em>Bikkyrringis
betwix Barnis</em>.&mdash;It is statut and ordainit be the prouest ballies
and counsall Forsamekle as ther has bene gret bikkyrringis betwix

<p>An anecdote which Scott has told of his share in the bickers
which took place in his youth between the George Square youth
and the plebeian fry of the neighbouring streets is so pat to this
occasion that its reproduction may be excusable. ‘It followed,’
he says, ‘from our frequent opposition to each other, that, though
not knowing the names of our enemies, we were yet well acquainted
with their appearance, and had nicknames for the most remarkable
of them. One very active and spirited boy might be considered
as the principal leader in the cohort of the suburbs. He was, I
suppose, thirteen or fourteen years old, finely made, tall, blue-eyed,
with long fair hair, the very picture of a youthful Goth.
This lad was always first in the charge and last in the retreat&mdash;the
Achilles, at once, and Ajax, of the Crosscauseway. He was
too formidable to us not to have a cognomen, and, like that of
a knight of old, it was taken from the most remarkable part of his
dress, being a pair of old green livery breeches, which was the
principal part of his clothing; for, like Pentapolin, according to
Don Quixote’s account, Green Breeks, as we called him, always
entered the battle with bare arms, legs, and feet.</p>

<p>‘It fell that, once upon a time, when the combat was at the
thickest, this plebeian champion headed a sudden charge, so rapid
and furious that all fled before him. He was several paces before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
his comrades, and had actually laid his hands on the patrician
standard, when one of our party, whom some misjudging friend
had entrusted with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couteau de chasse</i>, or hanger, inspired with a
zeal for the honour of the corps worthy of Major Sturgeon himself,
struck poor Green Breeks over the head with strength sufficient
to cut him down. When this was seen, the casualty was so far
beyond what had ever taken place before that both parties fled
different ways, leaving poor Green Breeks, with his bright hair
plentifully dabbled in blood, to the care of the watchman, who
(honest man) took care not to know who had done the mischief.
The bloody hanger was flung into one of the Meadow ditches,
and solemn secrecy was sworn on all hands; but the remorse and
terror of the actor were beyond all bounds, and his apprehensions
of the most dreadful character. The wounded hero was for a few
days in the Infirmary, the case being only a trifling one. But
though inquiry was strongly pressed on him, no argument could
make him indicate the person from whom he had received the
wound, though he must have been perfectly well known to him.
When he recovered, and was dismissed, the author and his brother
opened a communication with him, through the medium of a
popular gingerbread baker, of whom both parties were customers,
in order to tender a subsidy in name of smart-money. The sum
would excite ridicule were I to name it; but sure I am that the
pockets of the noted Green Breeks never held as much money of
his own. He declined the remittance, saying that he would not
sell his blood; but at the same time reprobated the idea of being
an informer, which he said was <em>clam</em>&mdash;that is, base or mean.
With much urgency he accepted a pound of snuff for the use of
some old woman&mdash;aunt, grandmother, or the like&mdash;with whom he
lived. We did not become friends, for the bickers were more
agreeable to both parties than any more pacific amusement; but
we conducted them ever after under mutual assurances of the
highest consideration for each other.’<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<h2><a name="SUSANNA_COUNTESS_OF_EGLINTOUNE" id="SUSANNA_COUNTESS_OF_EGLINTOUNE">SUSANNA, COUNTESS OF EGLINTOUNE.</a></h2>


<p>The house on the west side of the Old Stamp-office Close,
High Street, formerly Fortune’s Tavern, was, in the early
part of the last century, the family mansion of Alexander, Earl
of Eglintoune. It is a building of considerable height and extent,
accessible by a broad scale stair. The alley in which it is situated
bears great marks of former respectability, and contained, till
the year 1821, the Stamp-office, then removed to the Waterloo
Buildings.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The ninth Earl of Eglintoune<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> was one of those patriarchal
peers who live to an advanced age&mdash;indefatigable in the frequency
of their marriages and the number of their children&mdash;who linger
on and on, with an unfailing succession of young countesses, and
die at last leaving a progeny interspersed throughout the whole
of Douglas’s <cite>Peerage</cite>, two volumes, folio, re-edited by Wood.
His lordship, in early life, married a sister of Lady Dundee, who
brought him a large family, and died just about that happy period
when she could not have greatly increased it. His next wife was
a daughter of Chancellor Aberdeen, who only added one daughter
to his stock, and then paused, in a fit of ill-health, to the great
vexation of his lordship, who, on account of his two sons by the
first countess having died young, was anxious for an heir. This
was a consummation to his nuptial happiness which Countess Anne
did not seem at all likely to bring about, and the chagrin of his
lordship must have been increased by the longevity which her very
ill-health seemed to confer upon her; for her ladyship was one of
those valetudinarians who are too well acquainted with death,
being always just at his door, ever to come to closer quarters with
him. At this juncture the blooming Miss Kennedy was brought
to Edinburgh by her father, Sir Archibald, the rough old cavalier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
who made himself so conspicuous in <em>the Persecution</em> and in
Dundee’s wars.</p>

<p>Susanna Kennedy, though the daughter of a lady considerably
under the middle size&mdash;one of the three co-heiresses of the
Covenanting general, David Leslie (Lord Newark), whom Cromwell
overthrew at Dunbar&mdash;was six feet high, extremely handsome,
elegant in her carriage, and had a face and complexion of most
bewitching loveliness. Her relations and nurses always anticipated
that she was to marry the Earl of Eglintoune, in spite of their
disparity of age;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> for, while walking one day in her father’s garden
at Culzean, there alighted upon her shoulder a hawk, with his
lordship’s name upon its bells, which was considered an infallible
omen of her fate. Her appearance in Edinburgh, which took
place about the time of the Union, gained her a vast accession of
lovers among the nobility and gentry, and set all the rhyming
fancies of the period agog. Among her swains was Sir John Clerk
of Penicuik, a man of learning and talent in days when such
qualities were not common. As Miss Kennedy was understood to
be fond of music, he sent her a flute as a love-gift; from which it
may be surmised that this instrument was played by females in
that age, while as yet the pianoforte was not. When the young
lady attempted to blow the instrument, something was found to
interrupt the sound, which turned out to be a copy of verses in her
praise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Harmonious pipe, I languish for thy bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">When pressed to Silvia’s lips with gentle kiss!</div>
<div class="verse">And when her tender fingers round thee move</div>
<div class="verse">In soft embrace, I listen and approve</div>
<div class="verse">Those melting notes which soothe my soul in love.</div>
<div class="verse">Embalmed with odours from her breath that flow,</div>
<div class="verse">You yield your music when she’s pleased to blow;</div>
<div class="verse">And thus at once the charming lovely fair</div>
<div class="verse">Delights with sounds, with sweets perfumes the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Go, happy pipe, and ever mindful be</div>
<div class="verse">To court bewitching Silvia for me;</div>
<div class="verse">Tell all I feel&mdash;you cannot tell too much&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Repeat my love at each soft melting touch&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Since I to her my liberty resign,</div>
<div class="verse">Take thou the care to tune her heart to mine.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Unhappily for this accomplished and poetical lover, Lord
Eglintoune’s sickly wife happened just about this time to die, and
set his lordship again at large among the spinsters of Scotland.
Admirers of a youthful, impassioned, and sonnet-making cast
might have trembled at his approach to the shrine of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
divinity; for his lordship was one of those titled suitors who,
however old and horrible, are never rejected, except in novels and
romances. It appears that poor Clerk had actually made a
declaration of his passion for Miss Kennedy, which her father was
taking into consideration, a short while before the death of Lady
Eglintoune. As an old friend and neighbour, Sir Archibald
thought he would consult the earl upon the subject, and he
accordingly proceeded to do so. Short but decisive was the
conference. ‘Bide a wee, Sir Archy,’ said his lordship; ‘my
wife’s very sickly.’ With Sir Archibald, as with Mrs Slipslop,
the least hint sufficed: the case was at once settled against the
elegant baronet of Penicuik. The lovely Susanna accordingly
became in due time the Countess of Eglintoune.</p>

<p>Even after this attainment of one of the greatest blessings
that life has to bestow,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the old peer’s happiness was like to
have been destroyed by another untoward circumstance. It was
true that he had the handsomest wife in the kingdom, and she
brought him as many children as he could desire. One after
another came no fewer than seven daughters. But then his
lordship wanted a male heir; and every one knows how poor a
consolation a train of daughters, however long, proves in such a
case. He was so grieved at the want of a son that he threatened
to divorce his lady. The countess replied that he need not do
that, for she would readily agree to a separation, provided he
would give back what he had with her. His lordship, supposing
she alluded only to pecuniary matters, assured her she should have
her fortune to the last penny. ‘Na, na, my lord,’ said she, ‘that
winna do: return me my youth, beauty, and virginity, and dismiss
me when you please.’ His lordship, not being able to comply
with this demand, willingly let the matter drop; and before the
year was out her ladyship brought him a son, who established
the affection of his parents on an enduring basis. Two other
male children succeeded. The countess was remarkable for a
manner quite peculiar to herself, and which was remembered as
the <em>Eglintoune air</em>, or the <em>Eglintoune manner</em>, long after her
death. A Scottish gentleman, writing from London in 1730,
says: ‘Lady Eglintoune has set out for Scotland, much satisfied
with the honour and civilities shown her ladyship by the queen
and all the royal family: she has done her country more honour
than any lady I have seen here, both by a genteel and a prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
behaviour.’<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Her daughters were also handsome women. It was
a goodly sight, a century ago, to see the long procession of sedans,
containing Lady Eglintoune and her daughters, devolve from the
close and proceed to the Assembly Rooms, where there was sure
to be a crowd of plebeian admirers congregated to behold their
lofty and graceful figures step from the chairs on the pavement.
It could not fail to be a remarkable sight&mdash;eight beautiful women,
conspicuous for their stature and carriage, all dressed in the
splendid though formal fashions of that period, and inspired at
once with dignity of birth and consciousness of beauty! Alas!
such <em>visions</em> no longer illuminate the dark tortuosities of Auld
Reekie!</p>

<p>Many of the young ladies found good matches, and were the
mothers of men more or less distinguished for intellectual attainments.
Sir James Macdonald, the Marcellus of the Hebrides,
and his two more fortunate brothers, were the progeny of Lady
Margaret; and in various other branches of the family talent
seems to be hereditary.</p>

<p>The countess was herself a blue-stocking&mdash;at that time a sort
of prodigy&mdash;and gave encouragement to the humble literati of
her time. The unfortunate Boyse dedicated a volume of poems
to her; and I need scarcely remind the Scottish reader that the
<cite>Gentle Shepherd</cite> was laid at her ladyship’s feet. The dedication
prefixed to that pastoral drama contains what appears the usual
amount of extravagant praise; yet it was perhaps little beyond
the truth. For the ‘penetration, superior wit, and profound
judgment’ which Allan attributes to her ladyship, she was perhaps
indebted in some degree to the lucky accident of her having
exercised it in the bard’s favour; but he assuredly overstrained
his conscience very little when he said she was ‘possessed of every
outward charm in the most perfect degree.’ Neither was it too
much to speak of ‘the unfading beauties of wisdom and piety’
which adorned her ladyship’s mind.’<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Hamilton of Bangour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>’s
prefatory verses, which are equally laudatory and well bestowed,
contain the following beautiful character of the lady, with a just
compliment to her daughters:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘In virtues rich, in goodness unconfined,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shin’st a fair example to thy kind;</div>
<div class="verse">Sincere, and equal to thy neighbours’ fame,</div>
<div class="verse">How swift to praise, how obstinate to blame!</div>
<div class="verse">Bold in thy presence bashfulness appears,</div>
<div class="verse">And backward merit loses all its fears.</div>
<div class="verse">Supremely blest by Heaven, Heaven’s richest grace</div>
<div class="verse">Confest is thine&mdash;an early blooming race;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose pleasing smiles shall guardian wisdom arm&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Divine instruction!&mdash;taught of thee to charm,</div>
<div class="verse">What transports shall they to thy soul impart</div>
<div class="verse">(The conscious transports of a parent’s heart),</div>
<div class="verse">When thou behold’st them of each grace possessed,</div>
<div class="verse">And sighing youths imploring to be blest</div>
<div class="verse">After thy image formed, with charms like thine,</div>
<div class="verse">Or in the visit or the dance<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> to shine:</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice happy who succeed their mother’s praise,</div>
<div class="verse">The lovely Eglintounes of other days!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It may be remarked that her ladyship’s thorough-paced Jacobitism,
which she had inherited from her father, tended much to make
her the friend of Ramsay, Hamilton, and other Cavalier bards.
She was, it is believed, little given to patronising Whig poets.</p>

<p>The patriarchal peer who made Susanna so happy a mother
died in 1729, leaving her a dowager of forty, with a good jointure.
Retiring to the country, she employed her widowhood in the
education of her children, and was considered a perfect example to
all mothers in this useful employment. In our days of freer
manners, her conduct might appear too reserved. The young
were taught to address her by the phrase ‘Your ladyship;’ and she
spoke to them in the same ceremonious style. Though her eldest
son was a mere boy when he succeeded to the title, she constantly
called him Lord Eglintoune; and she enjoined all the rest of the
children to address him in the same manner. When the earl grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
up, they were upon no less formal terms; and every day in the
world he took his mother by the hand at the dinner-hour, and led
her downstairs to her chair at the head of his table, where she sat
in state, a perfect specimen of the stately and ostentatious politeness
of the last age.</p>

<p>All this ceremony was accompanied with so much affection
that the countess was never known to refuse her son a request but
one&mdash;to walk as a peeress at the coronation of King George III.
Lord Eglintoune, then a gentleman of the bedchamber, was proud
of his mother, and wished to display her noble figure on that
occasion. But she jestingly excused herself by saying that it was
not worth while for so old a woman to buy new robes.</p>

<p>The unhappy fate of her eldest and favourite son&mdash;shot by a
man of violent passions, whom he was rashly treating as a poacher
(1769)&mdash;gave her ladyship a dreadful shock in her old age. The
earl, after receiving the fatal wound, was brought to Eglintoune
Castle, when his mother was immediately sent for from Auchans.
What her feelings must have been when she saw one so dear to
her thus suddenly struck down in the prime of his days may be
imagined. The tenderness he displayed towards her and others
in his last hours is said to have been to the last degree noble and
affecting.</p>

<p>When Johnson and Boswell returned from their tour to the
Hebrides, they visited Lady Eglintoune at Auchans. She was so
well pleased with the doctor, his politics, and his conversation that
she embraced and kissed him at parting, an honour of which the
gifted tourist was ever afterwards extremely proud. Boswell’s
account of the interview is interesting. ‘Lady Eglintoune,’ says
he, ‘though she was now in her eighty-fifth year, and had lived in
the country almost half a century, was still a very agreeable woman.
Her figure was majestic, her manners high-bred, her reading extensive,
and her conversation elegant. She had been the admiration
of the gay circles, and the patroness of poets. Dr Johnson was
delighted with his reception here. Her principles in church and
state were congenial with his. In the course of conversation,
it came out that Lady Eglintoune was married the year before Dr
Johnson was born; upon which she graciously said to him that she
might have been his mother, and she now adopted him.’</p>

<p class="clear">This venerable woman amused herself latterly in taming and
patronising rats. She kept a vast number of these animals in her
pay at Auchans, and they succeeded in her affections to the poets
and artists whom she had loved in early life. It does not reflect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
much credit upon the latter that her ladyship used to complain of
never having met with true gratitude except from four-footed
animals. She had a panel in the oak wainscot of her
dining-room, which she tapped upon and opened at
meal-times, when ten or twelve jolly rats
came tripping forth and joined her at table.
At the word of command, or a signal from
her ladyship, they retired again obediently to their
native obscurity&mdash;a trait of good sense in the character
and habits of the animals which, it is hardly necessary to
remark, patrons do not always find in two-legged
protégés.</p>

<p class="clear">Her ladyship died in 1780, at the age of ninety-one,
having preserved her stately mien and beautiful
complexion to the last. The
latter was a mystery of fineness to many
ladies not the third of her age. As her secret
may be of service to modern beauties, I shall,
in kindness to the sex, divulge it. <em>She never
used paint, but washed her face periodically with <span class="smcap lowercase">SOW’S MILK</span>!</em> I
have seen a portrait, taken in her eighty-first year, in which it is
observable that her skin is of exquisite delicacy and tint. Altogether,
the countess was a woman of ten thousand!</p>

<p>The jointure-house of this fine old country-gentlewoman&mdash;Auchans
Castle, a capital specimen of the Scottish manor-house of
the seventeenth century, situated near Irvine&mdash;is now uninhabited,
and the handsome wainscoted rooms in which she entertained
Johnson and Boswell are fast hastening to decay. One last trait
may now be recorded; in her ladyship’s bedroom at this place was
hung a portrait of her sovereign <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</i>, the ill-starred Charles
Edward, so situated as to be <em>the first object which met her sight on
awaking in the morning</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="FEMALE_DRESSES_OF_LAST_CENTURY" id="FEMALE_DRESSES_OF_LAST_CENTURY">FEMALE DRESSES OF LAST CENTURY.</a></h2>


<p>Ladies in the last century wore dresses and decorations many
of which were of an inconvenient nature; yet no one can deny
them the merit of a certain dignity and grace. How fine it must
have been to see, as an old gentleman told me he had seen, two
hooped ladies moving along the Lawnmarket in a summer evening,
and filling up the whole footway with their stately and voluminous
persons!</p>

<p>Amongst female articles of attire in those days were calashes,
bongraces, capuchins, negligées, stomachers, stays, hoops, lappets,
pinners, plaids, fans, busks, rumple-knots, &amp;c., all of them now
forgotten.</p>

<p>The calash was a species of hood, constructed of silk upon a
framework of cane, and was used as a protection to a cap or head-dress
in walking out or riding in a carriage. It could be folded
back like the hood of a carriage, so as to lie gathered together
behind the neck.</p>

<p>The bongrace was a bonnet of silk and cane, in shape somewhat
like a modern bonnet.</p>

<p>The capuchin was a short cloak, reaching not below the elbows.
It was of silk, edged with lace, or of velvet. Gentlemen also wore
capuchins. The first Sir William Forbes frequently appeared at
the Cross in one. A lady’s <em>mode tippet</em> was nearly the same piece
of dress.</p>

<p>The negligée was a gown, projecting in loose and ample folds
from the back. It could only be worn with stays. It was entirely
open in front, so as to show the stomacher, across which it was
laced with flat silk cords, while below it opened more widely and
showed the petticoat. This latter, though shorter, was sometimes
more splendid than the gown, and had a deep flounce. Ladies in
walking generally carried the skirt of the gown over the arm, and
exhibited the petticoat; but when they entered a room, they
always came sailing in, with the train sweeping full and majestically
behind them.</p>

<p>The stomacher was a triangular piece of rich silk, one corner
pointing downwards and joining the fine black lace-bordered apron,
while the other two angles pointed to the shoulders. Great pains
were usually discovered in the adornment of this beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
most attractive piece of dress. Many wore jewels upon it; and a
lady would have thought herself poor indeed if she could not
bedizen it with strings of bugles or tinsel.</p>

<p>Stays were made so long as to touch the chair, both in front and
rear, when a lady sat. They were calculated to fit so tightly that
the wearers had to hold by the bedpost while the maid was lacing
them. There is a story told of a lady of high rank in Scotland,
about 1720, which gives us a strange idea of the rigours and
inconvenience of this fashion. She stinted her daughters as to diet,
with a view to the improvement of their shapes; but the young
ladies, having the cook in their interest, used to unlace their stays
at night, after her ladyship went to bed, and make a hearty meal.
They were at last discovered, by the smell of a roast goose, carried
upstairs to their bedchamber; as unluckily their lady-mother did
not take snuff,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and was not asleep.</p>

<p>The hoop was contemporary with, and a necessary appendage
of, the stays. There were different species of hoops, being of
various shapes and uses. The pocket-hoop, worn in the morning,
was like a pair of small panniers, such as one sees on an ass. The
bell-hoop was a sort of petticoat, shaped like a bell and made with
cane or rope for framework. This was not quite full-dress. There
was also a straw petticoat, a species of hoop such as is so common
in French prints. The full-sized evening hoop was so monstrous
that people saw one-half of it enter the room before the wearer.
This was very inconvenient in the Old Town, where doorways and
closes were narrow. In going down a close or a turnpike stair,
ladies tilted them up and carried them under their arms. In case
of this happening, there was a <em>show petticoat</em> below; and such care
was taken of appearances that even the <em>garters</em> were worn fine,
being either embroidered or having gold and silver fringes and
tassels.</p>

<p>The French silks worn during the last century were beautiful,
the patterns were so well drawn and the stuff of such excellent
quality. The dearest common brocade was about a guinea a yard;
if with gold or silver, considerably more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<p>The lappet was a piece of Brussels or point lace, hanging in
two pieces from the crown of the head and streaming gracefully
behind.</p>

<p>Pinners, such as the celebrated Egyptian Sphinx wears, were
pinned down the stomacher.</p>

<p>Plaids were worn by ladies to cover their heads and muffle their
faces when they went into the street. The council records of
Edinburgh abound in edicts against the use of this piece of dress,
which, they said, confounded decent women with those who were
the contrary.</p>

<p>Fans were large, the sticks curiously carved, and if of leather,
generally very well painted&mdash;being imported from Italy or Holland.
In later times these have been sometimes framed like pictures and
hung on the walls.</p>

<p>All women, high and low, wore enormous busks, generally with
a heart carved at the upper end. In low life this was a common
present to sweethearts; if from carpenters, they were artificially
veneered.</p>

<p>The rumple-knot was a large bunch of ribbons worn at the peak
of the waist behind. Knots of ribbons were then numerous over
the whole body. There were the breast-knots, two hainch-knots
(at which there were also buttons for looping up the gown behind),
a knot at the tying of the beads behind the neck, one in front and
another at the back of the head-gear, and knots upon the shoes.
It took about twelve yards or upwards to make a full suit of
ribbons.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Other minor articles of dress and adornment were the <em>befong</em>
handkerchief (spelt at random), of a stuff similar to what is now
called <em>net</em>, crossed upon the breast; paste ear-rings and necklace;
broad black bracelets at the wrists; a <em>pong pong</em>&mdash;a jewel fixed to
a wire with a long pin at the end, worn in front of the cap, and
which shook as the wearer moved. It was generally stuck in the
cushion over which the hair was turned in front. Several were
frequently worn at once. A song in the <cite>Charmer</cite>, 1751, alludes
to this bijou:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Come all ye young ladies whose business and care</div>
<div class="verse">Is contriving new dresses, and curling your hair;</div>
<div class="verse">Who flirt and coquet with each coxcomb who comes</div>
<div class="verse">To toy at your toilets, and strut in your rooms;</div>
<div class="verse">While you’re placing a patch, <em>or adjusting pong pong</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Ye may listen and learn by the truth of my song.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span></p>
<p>Fly-caps, encircling the head, worn by young matrons, and mob-caps,
falling down over the ears, used only by old ones; pockets
of silk or satin, of which young girls wore one above their other
attire; silk or linen stockings&mdash;never of cotton, which is a modern
stuff&mdash;slashed with pieces of a colour in strong contrast with the
rest, or gold or silver clocks, wove in. The silk stockings were
very thick, and could not be washed on account of the gold or
silver. They were frequently of scarlet silk, and (1733) worn both
by ladies and gentlemen. High-heeled shoes, set off with fine lace
or sewed work, and sharply pointed in front.</p>

<p>To give the reader a more picturesque idea of the former dresses
of the ladies of Edinburgh, I cite a couple of songs, the first wholly
old, the second a revivification:</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Mylne’s Court,
where some of the Mylne family resided.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This eminent person&mdash;a cadet of
the ancient house of Mar
(born 1680, died 1763)&mdash;had
his town mansion in an
obscure recess of the
High Street called
Mylne Square,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> the
first place bearing such
a designation in our
northern capital: it
was, I may remark,
built by one of a
family of Mylnes, who
are said to have been
master-masons to the
Scottish monarchs for
eight generations, and
some of whom are at this
day architects by profession.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Lord Alva’s residence was in the
second and third floors of the large
building on the west side of the
square. Of the same structure, an Earl
of Northesk occupied another <em>flat</em>. And,
to mark the character of Lord Alva’s abode,
part of it was afterwards, in the hands of a Mrs Reynolds,
used as a lodging-house of the highest grade. The Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
Hopetoun, while acting as Commissioner to the General
Assembly, there held viceregal state. But to return to Lord
Alva: it gives a curious idea of the habits of such a dignitary
before the rise of the New Town that we should find him
content with this dwelling while in immediate attendance upon
the court, and happy during the summer vacation to withdraw to
the shades of his little villa at Drumsheugh, standing on a spot
now surrounded by <em>town</em>. Lord Lovat, who, on account of his
numerous law-pleas, was a great intimate of Lord Alva’s, frequently
visited him here; and Mrs Campbell of Monzie, Lord Alva’s
daughter, used to tell that when she met Lord Lovat on the stair
he always took her up in his arms and kissed her, to her great
annoyance and horror&mdash;<em>he was so ugly</em>. During one of his law-pleas,
he went to a dancing-school ball, which Misses Jean and
Susanna, Lord Alva’s daughters, attended. He had his pocket
full of <em>sweeties</em>, as Mrs Campbell expressed it; and so far did he
carry his exquisitely refined system of cunning, that&mdash;in order no
doubt to find favour with their father&mdash;he devoted the greater
share of his attentions and the whole of his comfits to them alone.
Those who knew this singular man used to say that, with all his
duplicity, faithlessness, and cruelty, his character exhibited no
redeeming trait whatever: nobody ever knew any good of him.</p>

<p>In his Mylne Square mansion Lord Alva’s two step-daughters
were married; one to become Countess of Sutherland, the other
Lady Glenorchy. There was something very striking in the fate
of Lady Sutherland and of the earl, her husband&mdash;a couple
distinguished as much by personal elegance and amiable character
as by lofty rank. Lady Sutherland was blessed with a temper of
extraordinary sweetness, which shone in a face of so much beauty
as to have occasioned admiration where many were beautiful&mdash;the
coronation of George III. and his queen. The happiness of the
young pair had been increased by the birth of a daughter. One
unlucky day his lordship, coming after dinner into the drawing-room
at Dunrobin a little flushed with wine, lifted up the infant
above his head by way of frolic, when, sad to tell, he dropped her
by accident on the floor, and she received injuries from which she
never recovered. This incident had such an effect upon his lordship’s
spirits that his health became seriously affected, so as finally
to require a journey to Bath, where he was seized with an infectious
fever. For twenty-one successive days and nights he was attended
by his wife, then pregnant, till she herself caught the fatal distemper.
The countess’s death was concealed from his lordship;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
nevertheless, when his delirium left him, the day before he died,
he frequently said: ‘I am going to join my dear wife;’ appearing
to know that she had ‘already reached the goal with mended pace!’
Can it be that we are sometimes able to penetrate the veil which
hangs, in thick and gloomy folds, between this world and the next;
or does the ‘mortal coil’ in which the light of mind is enveloped
become thinner and more transparent by the wearing of deadly
sickness? The bodies of the earl and countess were brought to
Holyrood House, where they had usually resided when in town, and
lay in state for some time previous to their interment in one grave in
the Abbey Chapel. The death of a pair so young, so good, and
who had stood in so distinguished a position in society&mdash;leaving one
female infant to a disputed title&mdash;made a deep impression on the
public, and was sincerely lamented in their own immediate circle.
Of much poetry written on the occasion, a specimen may be seen
in Evans’s <cite>Old Ballads</cite>. Another appears in Brydges’s <cite>Censura
Literaria</cite>, being the composition of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse indent4">‘In pity, Heaven bestowed</div>
<div class="wideverse">An early doom: lo, on the self-same bier,</div>
<div class="wideverse">A fairer form, cold by her husband’s side,</div>
<div class="wideverse">And faded every charm. She died for thee,</div>
<div class="wideverse">For thee, her only love. In beauty’s prime,</div>
<div class="wideverse">In youth’s triumphant hour, she died for thee.</div>

<div class="wideverse">Of manners gentler, or of purer heart!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lady Glenorchy, the younger sister of Lady Sutherland, was
remarkable for her pious disposition. Exceedingly unfortunate in
her marriage, she was early taught to seek consolation from things
‘not of this world.’ I have been told that nothing could have
been more striking than to hear this young and beautiful creature
pouring forth her melodious notes and hymns, while most of her
sex and age at that time exercised their voices only upon the
wretched lyrics imported from Vauxhall and Ranelagh, or the
questionable verses of Ramsay and his contemporaries. She met
with her rich reward, even in this world; for she enjoyed the
applause of the wealthy and the blessings of the poor, with that
supreme of all pleasures&mdash;the conviction that the eternal welfare
of those in whose fate she was chiefly interested was forwarded, if
not perfected, by her precepts and example.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not unworthy of notice, in this record of all that is old
and quaint in our city, that the Lord Justice-clerk’s house was
provided with a <em>pin</em> or <em>risp</em>, instead of the more modern convenience&mdash;a
knocker. The Scottish ballads, in numberless passages,
make reference to this article: no hero in those compositions ever
comes to his mistress’s door but he <em>tirles at the pin</em>. What, then,
was a pin? It was a small slip or bar of iron, starting out from
the door vertically, serrated on the side towards the door, and
provided with a small ring, which, being drawn roughly along
the serrations or nicks, produced a harsh and grating sound, to
summon the servant to open. Another term for the article was
a <em>crow</em>. In the fourth eclogue of Edward Fairfax, a production
of the reign of James VI. and I., quoted in the <cite>Muses’ Library</cite>,
is this passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Now, farewell Eglon! for the sun stoops low,</div>
<div class="verse">And calling guests before my sheep-cot’s door;</div>
<div class="verse">Now <em>clad in white, I see my porter-crow</em>;</div>
<div class="verse">Great kings oft want these blessings of the poor;’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>with the following note: ‘The ring of the door, called a <em>crow</em>,
and when covered with white linen, denoted the mistress of the
house was in travel.’ It is quite appropriate
to this explanation that a small Latin vocabulary,
published by Andrew Simpson in 1702,
places among the parts of a house, ‘<em>Corvex&mdash;a
clapper or ringle</em>.’ Hardly one specimen of
the pin, crow, or ringle now survives in the
Old Town. They were almost all disused
many years ago, when knockers were generally
substituted as more stylish. Knockers at that
time did not long remain in repute, though
they have never been altogether superseded,
even by bells, in the Old Town. The comparative
merit of knockers and pins was for a
long time a controversial point, and many
knockers got their heads twisted off in the
course of the dispute. Pins were, upon the
whole, considered very inoffensive, decent, old-fashioned
things, being made of a modest metal, and making little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
show upon a door; knockers were thought upstart, prominent,
brazen-faced articles, and received the full share of odium always
conferred by Scotsmen of the old school upon tasteful improvements.
Every drunken fellow, in reeling home at night, thought
it good sport to carry off all the knockers that came in his way;
and as drunken gentlemen were very numerous, many acts of
violence were committed, and sometimes a whole stair was found
stripped of its knockers in the morning; when the voice of
lamentation raised by the servants of the sufferers might have
reminded one of the wailings of the Lennox dairy-women after a
<em>creagh</em> in the days of old. Knockers were frequently used as
missile weapons by the bucks of that day against the Town-guard;
and the morning sun sometimes saw the High Street strewed with
them. The aforesaid Mrs Campbell remembered residing in an
Old Town house, which was one night disturbed in the most
intolerable manner by a drunken party at the knocker. In the
morning the greater part of it was found to be gone; and it was
besides discovered, to the horror of the inmates, that part of a
finger was left sticking in the fragments, with the appearance of
having been forcibly wrenched from the hand.</p>

<h2><a name="MARLINS_AND_NIDDRYS_WYNDS" id="MARLINS_AND_NIDDRYS_WYNDS">MARLIN’S AND NIDDRY’S WYNDS.</a></h2>



<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Tradition of Marlin the Pavier&mdash;House of Provost Edward&mdash;Story
of Lady Grange.</strong></p>


<p>Where South Bridge Street now stands, there formerly
existed two wynds, or alleys, of the better class, named
Marlin’s and Niddry’s Wynds. Many persons of importance lived
in these obscurities. Marlin’s Wynd, which extended from behind
the Tron Church, and contained several bookshops and stalls, the
favourite lounge of the lovers of old literature, was connected with
a curious tradition, which existed at the time when Maitland
wrote his <cite>History of Edinburgh</cite> (1753). It was said that the
High Street was first paved or <em>causewayed</em> by one Marlin, a
Frenchman, who, thinking that specimen of his ingenuity the best
monument he could have, desired to be buried under it, and was
accordingly interred at the head of this wynd, which derived its
name from him. The tradition is so far countenanced by there
having formerly been a space in the pavement at this spot, marked
by six flat stones, in the shape of a grave. According, however,
to more authentic information, the High Street was first paved in
1532<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> by John and Bartoulme Foliot, who appear to have had
nothing in common with this legendary Marlin, except country.
The grave of at least Bartoulme Foliot is distinctly marked by a
flat monument in the Chapel-Royal at Holyrood House. It is
possible, nevertheless, that Marlin may have been the more
immediate executor or superintendent of the work.</p>

<p>Niddry’s Wynd abounded in curious antique houses, many of
which had been the residences of remarkable persons. The most
interesting <em>bit</em> was a paved court, about half-way down, on the
west side, called Lockhart’s Court, from its having latterly been
the residence of the family of Lockhart of Carnwath.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> This was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
in reality, a quadrangular palace, the whole being of elegant
old architecture in one design, and accessible by a deep arched
gateway. It was built by Nicol Edward, or Udward, who was
provost of Edinburgh in 1591; a wealthy citizen, and styled in
his <em>writts</em>, ‘of old descent in the burgh.’ On a mantelpiece
within the house his arms were carved, along with an anagram
upon his name:</p>

<p class="center">
VA D’UN VOL À CHRIST&mdash;
</p>

<p><em>Go with one flight to Christ</em>; which, the reader will find, can only
be made out by Latinising his name into <span class="smcap">Nicholaus Eduartus</span>.
We learn from Moyses’s <cite>Memoirs</cite> that, in January 1591, this house
was the temporary residence of James VI. and his queen, then
recently arrived from Denmark; and that, on the 7th of February,
the Earl of Huntly passed hence, out of the immediate royal
presence, when he went to murder the Bonny Earl of Moray at
Donibrissle; which caused a suspicion that His Majesty was concerned
in that horrid outburst of feudal hate. Lockhart’s Court
was latterly divided into several distinct habitations, one of which,
on the north side of the quadrangle, was occupied by the family
of Bruce of Kinnaird, the celebrated traveller. In the part on
the south side, occupied by the Carnwath family, there was a
mantelpiece in the drawing-room of magnificent workmanship,
and reaching to the ceiling. The whole mansion, even in its
reduced state, bore an appearance of security and strength which
spoke of other times; and there was, moreover, a profound
dungeon underground, which was only accessible by a secret trap-door,
opening through the floor of a small closet, the most remote
of a suite of rooms extending along the south and west sides of
the court. Perhaps, at a time when to be rich was neither so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
common nor so safe as now, Provost Edward might conceal his
hoards in this <em>massy more</em>.</p>

<p>Alexander Black of Balbirney, who was provost of Edinburgh
from 1579 to 1583, had a house at the head of the wynd. King
James lodged in this house on the 18th of August 1584, and
walked from it in state next day to hold a parliament in the
Tolbooth. Here also lodged the Chancellor Thirlstain, in
January 1591, while the king and queen were the guests of
Nicol Edward.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> It must be understood that these visits of
royalty were less considered in the light of an honour than of a
tax. The king in those times went to live at the board of a
wealthy subject when his own table happened to be scantily
furnished; which was too often the case with poor King James.</p>

<p>On the east side of the wynd, nearly opposite to Lockhart’s
Court, was a good house,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> which, early in the last century, was
possessed by James Erskine of Grange, best known by his judicial
title of Lord Grange, and the brother of John, Earl of Mar.
This gentleman has acquired an unhappy notoriety in consequence
of his treatment of his wife. He was externally a professor of
ultra-evangelical views of religion, and a patron of the clergy on
that side, yet in his private life is understood to have been far
from exemplary. The story of Lady Grange, as Mrs Erskine was
called, had a character of romance about it which has prevented it
from being forgotten. It also reflects a curious light upon the
state of manners in Scotland in the early part of the eighteenth
century. The lady was a daughter of that Chiesly of Dalry whom
we have already seen led by an insane violence of temper to commit
one of the most atrocious of murders.</p>


<h3>STORY OF LADY GRANGE.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></h3>

<p>Lord and Lady Grange had been married upwards of twenty
years, and had had several children, when, in 1730, a separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
was determined on between them. It is usually difficult in such
cases to say in what degree the parties are respectively blamable;
how far there have been positive faults on one side, and want of
forbearance on the other, and so forth. If we were to believe the
lady in this instance, there had been love and peace for twenty
years, when at length Lord Grange took a sudden dislike to his
wife, and would no longer live with her. He, on the other hand,
speaks of having suffered long from her ‘unsubduable rage and
madness,’ and of having failed in all his efforts to bring her
to a reasonable conduct. There is too much reason to believe
that the latter statement is in the main true; although, were it
more so, it would still leave Lord Grange unjustifiable in the
measures which he took with respect to his wife. It is traditionally
stated that in their unhappy quarrels the lady did not scruple
to remind her husband whose daughter she was&mdash;thus hinting at
what she was capable of doing if she thought herself deeply
aggrieved. However all this might be, in the year 1730 a
separation was agreed to (with great reluctance on the part of
the lady), his lordship consenting to give her a hundred a year
for her maintenance so long as she should continue to live apart
from him.</p>

<p>After spending some months in the country, Lady Grange
returned to Edinburgh, and took a lodging near her husband’s
house, for the purpose, as she tells us, of endeavouring to induce
him to take her back, and that she might occasionally see her
children. According to Lord Grange, she began to torment him
by following him and the children on the street ‘in a scandalous
and shameful manner,’ and coming to his house, and calling reproaches
to him through the windows,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> especially when there was
company with him. He thus writes: ‘In his house, at the bottom
of Niddry’s Wynd, where there is a court through which one
enters the house, one time among others, when it was full of chairs,
chairmen, and footmen, who attended the company that were with
himself, or his sister Lady Jane Paterson, then keeping house
together, she came into this court, and among that mob shamelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
cried up to the windows injurious reproaches, and would not
go away, though entreated, till, hearing the late Lord Lovat’s
voice, who was visiting Mr E&mdash;&mdash;, and seeing two of his servants
among the other footmen, “Oh,” said she, “is your master here?”
and instantly ran off.’ He speaks of her having attacked him one
day in church; at another time she forced him to take refuge
with his son in a tavern for two hours. She even threatened to
assault him on the bench, ‘which he every day expected; for she
professed that she had no shame.’</p>

<p>The traditionary account of Lady Grange represents her fate as
having been at last decided by her threatening to expose her
husband to the government for certain treasonable practices. It
would now appear that this was partially true. In his statement,
Lord Grange tells us that he had some time before gone to
London to arrange the private affairs of the Countess of Mar,
then become unable to conduct them herself, and he had sent an
account of his procedure to his wife, including some reflections on
a certain great minister (doubtless Walpole), who had thwarted
him much, and been of serious detriment to the interests of his
family in this matter. This document she retained, and she now
threatened to take it to London and use it for her husband’s
disadvantage, being supported in the design by several persons
with whom she associated. While denying that he had been
concerned in anything treasonable, Lord Grange says, ‘he had
already too great a load of that great minister’s wrath on his back
to stand still and see more of it fall upon him by the treachery
and madness of such a wife and such worthy confederates.’ The
lady had taken a seat in a stage-coach for London.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Lord
Grange caused a friend to go and make interest to get her money
returned, and the seat let to another person; in which odd
proceeding he was successful. Thus was the journey stayed for
the meantime; but the lady declared her resolution to go as soon
as possible. ‘What,’ says Lord Grange, ‘could a man do with
such a wife? There was great reason to think she would daily go
on to do mischief to her family, and to affront and bring a blot
on her children, especially her daughters. There were things that
could not be redressed in a court of justice, and we had not then
a madhouse to lock such unhappy people up in.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span></p>
<p>The result of his lordship’s deliberations was a plan for what he
calls ‘sequestrating’ his wife. It appears to have been concerted
between himself and a number of Highland chiefs, including,
above all, the notorious Lord Lovat.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> We now turn to the lady’s
narrative, which proceeds to tell that, on the evening of the 22nd
of January 1732, a party of Highlandmen, wearing the livery of
Lord Lovat, made their way into her lodgings, and forcibly seized
her, throwing her down and gagging her, then tying a cloth over
her head, and carrying her off as if she had been a corpse. At
the bottom of the stair was a chair containing a man, who took
the hapless lady upon his knees, and held her fast in his arms till
they had got to a place in the outskirts of the town. Then they
took her from the chair, removed the cloth from her head, and
mounted her upon a horse behind a man, to whom she was tied;
after which the party rode off ‘by the lee light of the moon,’ to
quote the language of the old ballads, whose incidents the present
resembles in character.</p>

<p>The treatment of the lady by the way was, if we can believe her
own account, by no means gentle. The leader, although a gentleman
(Mr Forster of Corsebonny), disregarded her entreaties to be
allowed to stop on account of cramp in her side, and only answered
by ordering a servant to renew the bandages over her mouth.
She observed that they rode along the Long Way (where Princes
Street now stands), past the Castle, and so to the Linlithgow road.
After a ride of nearly twenty miles, they stopped at Muiravonside,
the house of Mr John Macleod, advocate, where servants appeared
waiting to receive the lady&mdash;and thus showed that the master of
the house had been engaged to aid in her abduction. She was
taken upstairs to a comfortable bedroom; but a man being posted
in the room as a guard, she could not go to bed nor take any
repose. Thus she spent the ensuing day, and when it was night,
she was taken out and remounted in the same fashion as before;
and the party then rode along through the Torwood, and so to
the place called Wester Polmaise, belonging to a gentleman of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
name of Stewart, whose steward or factor was one of the cavalcade.
Here was an old tower, having one little room on each floor, as is
usually the case in such buildings; and into one of these rooms,
the window of which was boarded over, the lady was conducted.
She continued here for thirteen or fourteen weeks, supplied with a
sufficiency of the comforts of life, but never allowed to go into the
open air; till at length her health gave way, and the factor began
to fear being concerned in her death. By his intercession with
Mr Forster, she was then permitted to go into the court, under a
guard; but such was the rigour of her keepers that the garden
was still denied to her.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus time passed drearily on until the month of August, during
all which time the prisoner had no communication with the
external world. At length, by an arrangement made between Lord
Lovat and Mr Forster, at the house of the latter, near Stirling,
Lady Grange was one night forcibly brought out, and mounted
again as formerly, and carried off amidst a guard of horsemen.
She recognised several of Lovat’s people in this troop, and found
Forster once more in command. They passed by Stirling Bridge,
and thence onward to the Highlands; but she no longer knew the
way they were going. Before daylight they stopped at a house,
where she was lodged during the day, and at night the march
was resumed. Thus they journeyed for several days into the
Highlands, never allowing the unfortunate lady to speak, and
taking the most rigid care to prevent any one from becoming
aware of her situation. During this time she never had off her
clothes: one day she slept in a barn, another in an open enclosure.
Regard to delicacy in such a case was impossible. After a
fortnight spent at a house on Lord Lovat’s ground (probably in
Stratherrick, Inverness-shire), the journey was renewed in the
same style as before; only Mr Forster had retired from the party,
and the lady found herself entirely in the hands of Frasers.</p>

<p>They now crossed a loch into Glengarry’s land, where they
lodged several nights in cow-houses or in the open air, making
progress all the time to the westward, where the country becomes
extremely wild. At Lochourn, an arm of the sea on the west
coast, the unfortunate lady was transferred to a small vessel which
was in waiting for her. Bitterly did she weep, and pitifully
implore compassion; but the Highlanders understood not her
language; and though they had done so, a departure from the
orders which had been given them was not to be expected from
men of their character. In the vessel, she found that she was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
the custody of one Alexander Macdonald, a tenant of one of
the Western Islands named Heskir, belonging to Sir Alexander
Macdonald of Sleat; and here we have a curious indication of the
spirit in which the Highlanders conducted such transactions. ‘I
told him,’ says the lady, ‘that I was stolen at Edinburgh, and
brought there by force, and that it was contrary to the laws what
they were doing. He answered that he would not keep me, or
any other, against their will, <em>except Sir Alexander Macdonald were
in the affair</em>.’ While they lay in Lochourn, waiting for a wind,
the brother and son of Macdonald of Scothouse came to see but
not to relieve her. Other persons visited the sloop, and among
these one William Tolmy, a tenant of the chief of Macleod, and
who had once been a merchant at Inverness. This was the first
person she had seen who expressed any sympathy with her. He
undertook to bear information of her retreat to her friend and
‘man of business,’ Mr Hope of Rankeillor, in Edinburgh; but it
does not appear that he fulfilled his promise.</p>

<p>Lady Grange remained in Macdonald’s charge at Heskir nearly
two years&mdash;during the first year without once seeing bread, and
with no supply of clothing; obliged, in fact, to live in the same
miserable way as the rest of the family; afterwards some little
indulgence was shown to her. This island was of desolate aspect,
and had no inhabitant besides Macdonald and his wife. The
wretchedness of such a situation for a lady who had been all her
life accustomed to the refined society of a capital may of course
be imagined. Macdonald would never allow her to write to any
one; but he went to his landlord, Sir Alexander, to plead for the
indulgences she required. On one of these occasions, Sir Alexander
expressed his regret at having been concerned in such an affair,
and wished he were quit of it. The wonder is how Erskine should
have induced all these men to interest themselves in the ‘sequestration’
of his wife. One thing is here remarkable: they were all of
them friends of the Stuart family, as was Macleod of Macleod,
into whose hands the lady subsequently fell. It therefore becomes
probable that Erskine had at least convinced them that her
seclusion from the world was necessary in some way for the
preservation of political secrets important to them.</p>

<p>In June 1734 a sloop came to Heskir to take away the lady;
it was commanded by a Macleod, and in it she was conveyed to
the remotest spot of ground connected with the British Islands&mdash;namely,
the isle of St Kilda, the property of the chief of Macleod,
and remarkable for the simple character of the poor peasantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
who occupy it. There cannot, of course, be a doubt that those
who had an interest in the seclusion of Lady Grange regarded
this as a more eligible place than Heskir, in as far as it was more
out of the way, and promised better for her complete and permanent
confinement. In some respects it was an advantageous
change for the lady: the place was not uninhabited, as Heskir
very nearly was; and her domestic accommodation was better.
In St Kilda, she was placed in a house or cottage of two small
apartments, tolerably well furnished, with a girl to wait upon
her, and provided with a sufficiency of good food and clothing.
Of educated persons the island contained not one, except for a
short time a Highland Presbyterian clergyman, named Roderick
Maclennan. There was hardly even a person capable of speaking
or understanding the English language within reach. No books,
no intelligence from the world in which she had once lived. Only
once a year did a steward come to collect the rent paid in kind by
the poor people; and by him was the lady regularly furnished
with a store of such articles, foreign to the place, as she needed&mdash;usually
a stone of sugar, a pound of tea, six pecks of wheat, and an
anker of spirits.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Thus she had no lack of the common necessaries
of life; she only wanted society and freedom. In this way she
spent seven dreary years in St Kilda. How she contrived to pass
her time is not known. We learn, however, some particulars of
her history during this period from the testimony of those who
had a charge over her. If this is to be believed, she made
incessant efforts, though without effect, to bribe the islanders to
assist in liberating her. Once a stray vessel sent a boat ashore
for water; she no sooner heard of it than she despatched the
minister’s wife to apprise the sailors of her situation, and entreat
them to rescue her; but Mrs Maclennan did not reach the spot
till after they had departed. She was kind to the peasantry,
giving them from her own stores, and sometimes had the women
to come and dance before her; but her temper and habits were
not such as to gain their esteem. Often she drank too much; and
whenever any one near her committed the slightest mistake, she
would fly into a furious passion, and even resort to violence.
Once she was detected in an attempt, during the night, to obtain
a pistol from above the steward’s bed, in the room next to her
own. On his awaking and seeing her, she ran off to her own bed.
One is disposed, of course, to make all possible allowances for a
person in her wretched circumstances; yet there can be little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
doubt, from the evidence before us, that it was a natural and
habitual violence of temper which displayed itself during her
residence in St Kilda.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was known in Edinburgh that Lady Grange had
been forcibly carried away and placed in seclusion by orders of her
husband; but her whereabouts was a mystery to all besides a few
who were concerned to keep it secret. During the years which
had elapsed since her abduction, Mr Erskine had given up his seat
on the bench, and entered into political life as a friend of the
Prince of Wales and opponent of Sir Robert Walpole. The
world had wondered at the events of his domestic life, and several
persons denounced the singular means he had adopted for obtaining
domestic peace. But, in the main, he stood as well with society
as he had ever done. At length, in the winter of 1740-41, a
communication from Lady Grange for the first time reached her
friends. It was brought by the minister Maclennan and his wife,
who had left the island in discontent, after quarrelling with
Macleod’s steward. The idea of a lady by birth and education
being immured for a series of years in an outlandish place where
only the most illiterate peasantry resided, and this by the
command of a husband who could only complain of her irritable
temper, struck forcibly upon public feeling, and particularly upon
the mind of Lady Grange’s legal agent, Mr Hope of Rankeillor,
who had all along felt a keen interest in her fate. Of Mr Hope it
may be remarked that he was also a zealous Jacobite; yet, though
all the persons engaged in the lady’s abduction were of that party,
he hesitated not to take active measures on the contrary side.
He immediately applied to the Lord Justice-clerk (supreme
criminal judge) for a warrant to search for and liberate Lady
Grange. This application was opposed by the friends of Mr
Erskine, and eventually it was defeated; yet he was not on that
account deterred from hiring a vessel, and sending it with armed
men to secure the freedom of the lady&mdash;a step which, as it was
illegal and dangerous, obviously implied no small risk on his own
part. This ship proceeded no farther than the harbour called the
Horse-shoe, in Lorn (opposite to the modern town of Oban), where
the master quarrelled with and set on shore Mrs Maclennan, his
guide. Apparently the voyage was not prosecuted in consequence
of intelligence being received that the lady had been removed to
another place, where she was kept in more humane circumstances.
If so, its object might be considered as in part at least, though
indirectly, accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen a warrant, signed in the holograph of Normand
Macleod&mdash;the same insular chief who, a few years after, lost
public respect in consequence of his desertion of the Jacobite
cause, and showing an active hostility to Prince Charles when in
hiding. The document is dated at Dunvegan, February 17,
1741, and proceeds upon a rumour which has reached the writer
that a certain gentlewoman, called Lady Grange, was carried to
his isle of St Kilda in 1734, and has ever since been confined
there under cruel circumstances. Regarding this as a scandal
which he is bound to inquire into (as if it could have hitherto
been a secret to him), he orders his baron-bailie of Harris,
Donald Macleod of Bernera (this was a gallant fellow who went
out in the ’Forty-five), to proceed to that island and make the
necessary investigations. I have also seen the original precognition
taken by honest Donald six days thereafter, when the
various persons who had been about Lady Grange gave evidence
respecting her. The general bearing of this testimony, besides
establishing the fact of her confinement as a prisoner, is to the
effect that she was treated well in all other respects, having a
house forty feet long, with an inner room and a chimney to it,
a curtained bed, arm-chair, table, and other articles; ample store
of good provisions, including spirits; and plenty of good
clothes; but that she was addicted to liquor, and liable to
dreadful outbreaks of anger. Evidence was at the same time
taken regarding the character of the Maclennans, upon whose
reports Mr Hope had proceeded. It was Mr Erskine’s interest
to establish that they were worthless persons, and to this effect
strong testimony was given by several of the islanders, though
it would be difficult to say with what degree of verity. The
whole purpose of these precognitions was to meet the clamours
raised by Mr Hope as to the barbarities to which Lady Grange
had been subjected. They had the effect of stopping for a
time the legal proceedings threatened by that gentleman; but
he afterwards raised an action in the Court of Session for payment
of the arrears of aliment or allowance due to the lady,
amounting to £1150, and obtained decreet or judgment in the
year 1743 against the defender in absence, though he did not
choose to put it in force.</p>

<p>The unfortunate cause of all these proceedings ceased to be a
trouble to any one in May 1745. Erskine, writing from Westminster,
June 1, in answer to an intimation of her death, says:
‘I most heartily thank you, my dear friend, for the timely notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
you gave me of the death of <em>that person</em>. It would be a
ridiculous untruth to pretend grief for it; but as it brings to my
mind a train of various things for many years back, it gives me
concern. Her retaining wit and facetiousness to the last surprises
me. These qualities none found in her, no more than
common-sense or good-nature, before she went to these parts;
and of the reverse of all which, if she had not been irrecoverably
possest, in an extraordinary and insufferable degree, after many
years’ fruitless endeavours to reclaim her, she had never seen
these parts. I long for the particulars of her death, which, you
are pleased to tell me, I am to have by next post.’</p>

<p>Mr Hope’s wife and daughters being left as heirs of Lady
Grange, an action was raised in their name for the £1150
formerly awarded, and for three years additional of her annuity;
and for this compound sum decreet was obtained, which was
followed by steps for forcing payment. The Hopes were aware,
however, of the dubious character of this claim, seeing that Mr
Erskine, from whatever causes, had substituted an actual subsistence
since 1732. They accordingly intimated that they aimed
at no personal benefit from Lady Grange’s bequest; and the
affair terminated in Mr Erskine reimbursing Mr Hope for all
the expenses he had incurred on behalf of the lady, including
that for the sloop which he had hired to proceed to St Kilda for
her rescue.</p>

<p>It is humbly thought that this story casts a curious and faithful
light upon the age of our grandfathers, showing things in a kind
of transition from the sanguinary violence of an earlier age to the
humanity of the present times. Erskine, not to speak of his
office of a judge in Scotland, moved in English society of the
highest character. He must have been the friend of Lyttelton,
Pope, Thomson, and other ornaments of Frederick’s court; and
as the brother-in-law of the Countess of Mar, who was sister of
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, he would figure in the brilliant circle
which surrounded that star of the age of the second George. Yet
he does not appear to have ever felt a moment’s compunction at
leaving the mother of his children to pine and fret herself to
death in a half-savage wilderness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Placed far amidst the melancholy main;’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for in a paper which expresses his feelings on the subject pretty
freely, he justifies the ‘sequestration’ as a step required by
prudence and decency; and in showing that the gross necessaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
of life were afforded to his wife, seems to have considered
that his whole duty towards her was discharged. Such an insensibility
could not be peculiar to one man: it indicates the
temper of a class and of an age. While congratulating ourselves
on the improved humanity of our own times, we may glance with
satisfaction to the means which it places in our power for the
proper treatment of patients like Mrs Erskine. Such a woman
would now be regarded as the unfortunate victim of disease,
and instead of being forcibly carried off under cloud of night by
a band of Highlanders, and committed to confinement on the
outskirts of the world, she would, with proper precautions, be
remitted to an asylum, where, by gentle and rational management,
it might be hoped that she would be restored to mental
health, or, at the worst, enabled to spend the remainder of her
days in the utmost comfort which her state admitted of.</p>

<p>[1868.&mdash;About the middle of Cant’s Close,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> on the west side,
there exists a remarkable edifice, different from all others in the
neighbourhood. It is two
stories in height, the second
story being reached by an
outside stone stair within
a small courtyard, which
had originally been shut in
by a gate. The stone pillars
of the gateway are decorated
with balls at the top, as
was the fashion of entrances
to the grounds of a country
mansion. The building is
picturesque in character, in
the style of the sixteenth
century in Scotland. As
it resembles a neat, old-fashioned
country-house, one
wonders to find it jammed
up amidst tall edifices in this confined alley. Ascending the stair,
we find that the interior consists of three or four apartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
with handsome panelled walls and elaborately carved stucco
ceilings. The principal room has a double window on the west
to Dickson’s Close.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Mansion, Cant’s Close.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Daniel Wilson, in his <cite>Memorials of Edinburgh</cite>, speaks of this
building in reference to Dickson’s Close. He says: ‘A little
lower down the close on the same side, an old and curious stone
tenement bears on its lower crow-step the Haliburton arms,
impaled with another coat, on one shield. It is a singularly
antique and time-worn edifice, evidently of considerable antiquity.
A curious double window projects on a corbelled base into the
close, while the whole stone-work is so much decayed as greatly
to add to its picturesque character. In the earliest deed which
exists, bearing date 1582, its first proprietor, Master James
Halyburton&mdash;a title then of some meaning&mdash;is spoken of in
indefinite terms as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">umq<sup>le</sup></i>, or deceased; so that it is a building
probably of the early part of the sixteenth century.’ It is known
that the adjoining properties on the north once pertained to
the collegiate church of Crichton; while those on the east, in
Strichen’s Close, comprehended the town residence of the Abbot
of Melrose, 1526.</p>

<p>The adjoining woodcut [<a href="#Page_222">p. 221</a>] will give some idea of this
strange old mansion in Cant’s Close, with its gateway and flight of
steps. In looking over the titles, we find that the tenement was
conveyed in 1735 from Robert Geddes of Scotstoun, Peeblesshire,
to George Wight, a burgess of Edinburgh, since which period it
has gradually deteriorated; every apartment, from the ground to
the garret, is now a dwelling for a separate family; and the
whole surroundings are most wretched. The edifice formed one
of the properties removed under the Improvement Act of 1867.]</p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Sir George Mackenzie&mdash;Lady Anne Dick.</strong></p>


<p>In Catholic times several of the great dignitaries of the Church
had houses in Edinburgh, as the Archbishop of St Andrews
at the foot of Blackfriars
Wynd, the Bishop of Dunkeld
in the Cowgate, and
the Abbot of Cambuskenneth
in the Lawnmarket.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
The Abbot of Melrose’s
‘lodging’ appears from
public documents to have
been in what is now called
Strichen’s Close, in the High
Street, immediately to the
west of Blackfriars Wynd.
It had a garden extending
down to the Cowgate and
up part of the opposite
slope.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Strichen’s Close.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A successor of the abbot
in this possession was Sir
George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh,
king’s advocate in
the reigns of Charles II.
and James II., and author
of several able works in
Scottish law, as well as a
successful cultivator of miscellaneous
literature. He
got a charter of the property
from the magistrates in 1677. The house occupied by Sir
George still exists,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and appears to have been a goodly enough
mansion for its time. It is now, however, possessed by a brass-founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
as a place of business. From Sir George the alley was
called Rosehaugh’s Close, till, this house falling by marriage connection
into the possession
of Lord Strichen,
it got the name of
Strichen’s Close, which
it still bears. Lord
Strichen was a judge of
the Court of Session for
forty-five years subsequent
to 1730. He was
the direct ancestor of the
present Lord Lovat of
the British peerage.</p>

<p>Mackenzie has still a
place in the popular
imagination in Edinburgh
as the <em>Bluidy
Mackingie</em>, his office having
been to prosecute the
unruly Covenanters. It
therefore happens that
the founder of our
greatest national library,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> one whom Dryden regarded as a
friend, and who was the very first writer of classic English
prose in Scotland, is a sort of Raw-head and Bloody-bones
by the firesides of his native capital. He lies in a beautiful
mausoleum, which forms a conspicuous object in the Greyfriars
Churchyard, and which describes him as an ornament to his age,
and a man who was kind to all, ‘except a rebellious crew, from
whose violence, with tongue and pen, he defended his country and
king, whose virulence he stayed by the sword of justice, and whose
ferocity he, by the force of reason, blunted, and only did not
subdue.’ This monument was an object of horror to the good
people of Edinburgh, as it was almost universally believed that
the spirit of the persecutor could get no rest in its superb but
gloomy tenement. It used to be ‘a feat’ for a set of boys, in a
still summer evening, to march up to the ponderous doors, bedropt
with white tears upon a black ground, and cry in at the keyhole:&mdash;</p>

<p>after which they would run away as if some hobgoblin were in
chase of them, probably not looking round till they were out of
the churchyard.</p>

<p>Sir George Mackenzie had a country-house called Shank, about
ten miles to the south of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> now a ruin. One day the
Marquis of Tweeddale, having occasion to consult him about some
law business, rode across the country, and arrived at so early an
hour in the morning that the lawyer was not yet out of bed.
Soliciting an immediate audience, he was admitted to the bedroom,
where he sat down and detailed the case to Sir George, who
gave him all necessary counsel from behind the curtains. When
the marquis advanced to present a fee, he was startled at the
apparition of a female hand through the curtains, in an attitude
expressive of a readiness to receive, while no hand appeared on the
part of Sir George. The explanation was that Sir George’s lady,
as has been the case with many a weaker man, took entire charge
of his purse.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Several of the descendants of this great lawyer have been
remarkable for their talents. None, perhaps, possessed more
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivida vis animi</i> than his granddaughter, Lady Anne
Dick of Corstorphine (also granddaughter, by the father’s side,
to the clever but unscrupulous ‘Tarbat Register,’ the first Earl of
Cromarty).<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> This lady excited much attention in Edinburgh
society by her eccentric manners and her droll pasquinade
verses: one of those beings she was who astonish, perplex, and
fidget their fellow-creatures, till at last the world feels a sort of
relief when they are removed from the stage. She made many
enemies by her lampoons; and her personal conduct only afforded
them too good room for revenge. Sometimes she would dress
herself in men’s clothes, and go about the town in search of
adventures. One of her frolics ended rather disgracefully, for
she and her maid, being apprehended in their disguise, were
lodged all night in the Town Guard-house. It may be readily
imagined that by those whom her wit had exasperated such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
follies would be deeply relished and made the most of. We must
not, therefore, be surprised at Scandal telling that Lady Anne had
at one period lain a whole year in bed, in a vain endeavour&mdash;to
baffle <em>himself</em>.</p>

<p>Through private channels have oozed out at this late day a
few specimens of Lady Anne’s poetical abilities; less brilliant than
might be expected from the above character of her, yet having a
certain air of dash and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espièglerie</i> which looks appropriate. They
are partly devoted to bewailing the coldness of a certain Sir Peter
Murray of Balmanno, towards whom she chose to act as a sort of
she-Petrarch, but apparently in the mere pursuit of whim. One
runs in the following tender strain:</p>

she breaks out as follows:</p>

<p>Her ladyship died, without issue, in 1741.</p>

<h2><a name="BLACKFRIARS_WYND" id="BLACKFRIARS_WYND">BLACKFRIARS WYND.</a></h2>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Palace of Archbishop Bethune&mdash;Boarding-schools of the Last
Century&mdash;The Last of the Lorimers&mdash;Lady Lovat.</strong></p>


<p>Those who now look into Blackfriars Wynd&mdash;passing through
it is out of the question&mdash;will be surprised to learn that, all
dismal and wretched as it is in all respects, it was once a place of
some respectability and even dignity. On several of its tall old
<em>lands</em> may be seen inscriptions implying piety on the part of the
founder&mdash;one, for example:</p>

<p class="center">
PAX INTRANTIBUS,<br />
SALUS EXEUNTIBUS;<br />
</p>

<p>another:</p>

<p class="center">
MISERERE MEI, DEUS;<br />
</p>

<p>this last containing in its <em>upper floor</em> all that the adherents of
Rome had forty years ago as a place of worship in Edinburgh&mdash;the
chapel to which, therefore, as a matter of course, the late
Charles X. resorted with his suite, when residing as Comte d’Artois
in Holyrood House. The alley gets its name from having been
the access to the Blackfriars’ Monastery on the opposite slope, and
being built on their land.</p>


<h3>PALACE OF ARCHBISHOP BETHUNE [OR BEATON].</h3>

<p>At the foot of the wynd, on the east side, is a large mansion
of antique appearance, forming two sides of a quadrangle, with a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> giving access to a court behind, and a picturesque
overhanging turret at the exterior angle.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> This house was built
by James Bethune, Archbishop of Glasgow (1508-1524), chancellor
of the kingdom, and one of the Lords Regent under the Duke
of Albany during the minority of James V. Lyndsay, in his
<cite>Chronicles</cite>, speaks of it as ‘his owen ludging quhilk he biggit in
the Freiris Wynd.’ Keith, at a later period, says: ‘Over the
entry of which the arms of the family of Bethune are to be
seen to this day.’ Common report represents it as the house
of Cardinal Bethune, who was the nephew of the Archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
Glasgow; and it is not improbable that the one prelate bequeathed
it to the other, and that it thus became what Maitland calls it,
‘the archiepiscopal palace belonging to the see of St Andrews.’</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Cardinal Bethune’s House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ground-floor of this extensive
building is arched over
with strong stone-work, after
the fashion of those houses of
defence of the same period
which are still scattered over
the country. Some years ago,
when one of the arches was
removed to make way for a
common ceiling, a thick layer
of sand, firmly beaten down,
was found between the surface
of the vault and the floor
above. Ground-floors thus
formed were applied in former
times to inferior domestic uses,
and to the storing of articles
of value. The chief apartments
for living in were on
the floor above&mdash;that is, the
so-called <em>first floor</em>. And such
is the case in all the best
houses of an old fashion in the city of St Andrews at this day.</p>

<p>I shall afterwards have something to say of an event of the year
1517, with which Archbishop Bethune’s house was connected. It
appears to have been occupied by James V. in 1528, while he was
deliberating on the propriety of calling a parliament.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The Bethune palace is now, like its confrères, abandoned to the
humblest class of tenants. Eighty years ago, however, it must
still have been a tolerably good house, as it was then the residence
of Bishop Abernethy Drummond, of the Scottish Episcopal communion,
the husband of the heiress of Hawthornden. This worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
divine occupied some space in the public eye in his day, and was
particularly active in obtaining the repeal of the penal statutes
against his church. Some wag, figuring the surprise in high places
at a stir arising from a quarter so obscure, penned this epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Lord Sydney, to the privy-council summoned,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">By testy majesty was questioned quick:</div>
<div class="verse">“Eh, eh! who, who’s this Abernethy Drummond,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And where, in Heaven’s name, is his bishopric?”’</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>BOARDING-SCHOOLS OF THE LAST CENTURY.</h3>

<p>When the reader hears such things of the Freir Wynd, he must
not be surprised overmuch on perusing the following advertisement
from the <cite>Edinburgh Gazette</cite> of April 19, 1703: ‘There is a
Boarding-school to be set up in Blackfriars Wynd, in Robinson’s
Land, upon the west side of the wynd, near the middle thereof, in
the first door of the stair leading to the said land, against the
latter end of May, or first of June next, where young Ladies and
Gentlewomen may have all sorts of breeding that is to be had in
any part of Britain, and great care taken of their conversation.’</p>

<p>I know not whether this was the same seminary which, towards
the middle of the century, was kept by a distinguished lady named
Mrs Euphame or Effie Sinclair, who was descended from the ancient
family of Longformacus, in Berwickshire, being the granddaughter
of Sir Robert Sinclair, first baronet of Longformacus, upon whom
that dignity was conferred by King Charles II., in consideration
of his services and losses during the civil war. Mrs Effie was
allied to many of the best families in Scotland, who made it a
duty to place their children under her charge; and her school was
thus one of the most respectable in Edinburgh. By her were
educated the beautiful Miss Duff, afterwards Countess of Dumfries
and Stair, and, by a second marriage, lady of the Honourable
Alexander Gordon (Lord Rockville); the late amiable and excellently
well informed Mrs Keith, sister of Sir Robert Keith,
commonly called, from his diplomatic services, <em>Ambassador Keith</em>;<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
the two Misses Hume of Linthill; and Miss Rutherford, the
mother of Sir Walter Scott. All these ladies were Scottish cousins
to Mrs Effie. To judge by the proficiency of her scholars, although
much of what is called accomplishment might be then left untaught,
she must have been possessed of uncommon talents for education;
for all the ladies before mentioned had well-cultivated minds, were
fond of reading, wrote and spelled admirably, were well acquainted
with history and with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, without neglecting the more
homely duties of the needle and the account-book; and, while two
of them were women of extraordinary talents, all of them were
perfectly well-bred in society.</p>

<div class="figcenter w275">
<img src="images/illus_p_231.jpg" width="275" height="176" alt="Two cows." />
</div>

<p>It may be added that many of these young ladies were sent to
reside with and be <em>finished off</em> by the Honourable Mrs Ogilvie,
lady of the Honourable Patrick Ogilvie of Longmay and Inchmartin,
who was supposed to be the <em>best-bred</em> woman of her time
in Scotland (ob. 1753). Her system was very rigorous, according
to the spirit of the times. The young ladies were taught to sit
quite upright; and the mother of my informant (Sir Walter Scott),
even when advanced to nearly her eightieth year, never permitted
her back to touch the chair in sitting. There is a remarkably
good and characteristic anecdote told of the husband of this
rigorous preceptress, a younger brother of the Earl of Findlater,
whose exertions, while Lord
High-chancellor of Scotland, in
favour of the Union were so conspicuous.
The younger brother, it
appears, had condescended to trade
a little in cattle, which was not
considered derogatory to the dignity
of a Scottish gentleman at that
time, and was by no means an
uncommon practice among them.
However, the earl was offended at the measure, and upbraided
his brother for it. ‘Haud your tongue, man!’ said the cattle-dealer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
‘better sell nowte than sell nations,’ pronouncing the last
word with peculiar and emphatic breadth.</p>

<p>I am tempted, by the curious and valuable document
appended, to suspect that the female accomplishments of the
last century were little behind those of the present in point of
useless elaboration.</p>

<p>‘<em>Thursday, December 9, 1703.</em>&mdash;Near Dundee, at Dudhope,
there is to be taught, by a gentlewoman from London, the following
works, viz.&mdash;1. Wax-work of all sorts, as any one’s picture to the
life, figures in shadow glasses, fruits upon trees or in dishes, all
manner of confections, fish, flesh, fowl, or anything that can be
made of wax.&mdash;2. Philligrim-work of any sort, whether hollow or
flat.&mdash;3. Japan-work upon timber or glass.&mdash;4. Painting upon

<p>Another distinguished Edinburgh boarding-school of the last
century was kept by two ladies, of Jacobite predilections, named
the Misses Ged, in Paterson’s Court, Lawnmarket. They were
remarkable at least for their family connections, for it was a
brother of theirs who, under the name of Don Patricio Ged,
rendered such kindly and effective service to Commodore Byron,
as gratefully recorded in the well-known <cite>Narrative</cite>, and gracefully
touched on by Campbell in the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘He found a warmer world, a milder clime,</div>
<div class="verse">A home to rest, a shelter to defend,</div>
<div class="verse">Peace and repose, <em>a Briton and a friend</em>.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another member of the family, William Ged, originally a goldsmith
in Edinburgh, was the inventor of stereotype printing.
The Misses Ged were described by their friends as of the Geds of
Baldridge, near Dunfermline; thorough Fife Jacobites every one of
them. The old ladies kept a portrait of the Chevalier in their
parlour, and looked chiefly to partisans of the Stuarts for support.
They had another relative of less dignity, who, accepting a situation
in the Town-guard, became liable to satiric reference from
Robert Fergusson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Nunc est bibendum, et bendere bickerum magnum,</div>
<div class="verse">Cavete Town-guardum, <em>Dougal Geddum</em>, atque Campbellum.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dougal had been a silversmith, but in his own conceit his red
coat as a Town-guard officer made him completely military.
Seeing a lady without a beau at the door of the Assembly Room,
he offered his services, ‘if the arm of an old soldier could be of
any use.’ ‘Hoot awa, Dougal,’ said the lady, accepting his
assistance, however; ‘an auld tinkler, you mean.’</p>


<h3>THE LAST OF THE LORIMERS.</h3>

<p>To return for a moment to the archiepiscopal palace. It
contained, about eighty years ago, a person calling himself a
<span class="smcap">Lorimer</span>&mdash;an appellative once familiar in Edinburgh, being applied
to those who deal in the ironwork used in saddlery.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span></p>

<h3>LADY LOVAT.</h3>

<p>The widow of the rebel Lord Lovat spent a great portion of a
long widowhood and died (1796) in a house at the head of
Blackfriars Wynd.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was a niece of the first Duke of Argyll, and born,
as she herself expressed it, in the year <em>Ten</em>&mdash;that is, 1710. The
politic <em>Mac Shemus</em><a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> marked her out as a suitable second wife,
in consideration of the value of the Argyll connection. As he
was above thirty years her senior, and not famed for the tenderest
treatment of his former spouse, or for any other amiable trait of
disposition, she endeavoured, by all gentle means, to avoid the
match; but it was at length effected through the intervention
of her relations, and she was carried north to take her place in
the semi-barbarous state which her husband held at Castle Downie.</p>

<p>Nothing but misery could have been expected from such an
alliance. The poor young lady, while treated with external
decorum, was in private subjected to such usage as might have
tried the spirit of a Griselda. She was occasionally kept confined
in a room by herself, from which she was not allowed to
come forth even at meals, only a scanty supply of coarse food
being sent to her from his lordship’s table. When pregnant, her
husband coolly told her that if she brought forth a girl he
would put it on the back of the fire. His eldest son by the
former marriage was a sickly child. Lovat therefore deemed it
necessary to raise a strong motive in the step-mother for the
child being taken due care of during his absence in the Lowlands.
On going from home, he would calmly inform her that any harm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
befalling <em>the boys</em> in his absence would be attended with the
penalty of her own death, for in that event he would undoubtedly
shoot her through the head. It is added that she did, from this
in addition to other motives, take an unusual degree of care of her
step-son, who ever after felt towards her the tenderest love and
gratitude. One is disposed to believe that there must be some
exaggeration in these stories; and yet when we consider that
it is an historical fact that Lovat applied to Prince Charles for a
warrant to take President Forbes <em>dead or alive</em> (Forbes being his
friend and daily intimate), it seems no extravagance that he
should have acted in this manner to his wife. Sir Walter Scott
tells an additional story, which helps out the picture. ‘A lady,
the intimate friend of her youth, was instructed to visit Lady
Lovat, as if by accident, to ascertain the truth of those rumours
concerning her husband’s conduct which had reached the ears of
her family. She was received by Lord Lovat with an extravagant
affectation of welcome, and with many assurances of the happiness
his lady would receive from seeing her. The chief then went to
the lonely tower in which Lady Lovat was secluded, without
decent clothes, and even without sufficient nourishment. He laid
a dress before her becoming her rank, commanded her to put it
on, to appear, and to receive her friend as if she were the mistress
of the house; in which she was, in fact, a naked and half-starved
prisoner. And such was the strict watch which he maintained,
and the terror which his character inspired, that the visitor durst
not ask, nor Lady Lovat communicate, anything respecting her
real situation.’<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Afterwards, by a letter rolled up in a clew of
yarn and dropped over a window to a confidential person, she
was enabled to let her friends know how matters actually stood;
and steps were then taken to obtain her separation from her
husband. When, some years later, his political perfidy had
brought him to the Tower&mdash;forgetting all past injuries, and
thinking only of her duty as a wife, Lady Lovat offered to come
to London to attend him. He returned an answer, declining
the proposal, and containing the only expressions of kindness and
regard which she had ever received from him since her marriage.</p>

<p>The singular character of Lord Lovat makes almost every
particular regarding him worth collecting.</p>

<p>Previous to 1745, when the late Mr
Alexander Baillie of Dochfour was a student
at the grammar-school of Inverness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
cock-fights were very common among the boys. This detestable
sport, by the way, was encouraged by the schoolmasters of those
days, who derived a profit from the beaten cocks, or, as they
were called, <em>fugies</em>, which became, at the end of every game,
their appropriated perquisite. In pursuit of cocks, Mr Baillie
went to visit his friends in the Aird, and in the course of his
researches was introduced to Lord Lovat, whose policy it was,
on all occasions, to show great attentions to his neighbours and
their children. The situation in which his lordship was found
by the schoolboy was, if not quite unprecedented, nevertheless
rather surprising. He was stretched out in bed between two
Highland lasses, who, on being seen, affected out of modesty to
hide their faces under the bedclothes. The old lord accounted
for this strange scene by saying that his blood had become cold,
and he was obliged to supply the want of heat by the application
of animal warmth.</p>

<p>It is said that he lay in bed for the most part of the two years
preceding the Rebellion; till, hearing of Prince Charles’s arrival
in Arisaig, he roused himself with sudden vehemence, crying to an
attendant: ‘Lassie, bring me my brogues&mdash;I’ll rise <em>noo</em>!’</p>

<p>One of his odd fancies was to send a retainer every day to
Loch Ness, a distance of eight miles, for the water he drank.</p>

<p>His intimacy with his neighbour President Forbes is an
amusing affair, for the men must have secretly known full well
what each other was, and yet policy made them keep on decent
terms for a long course of years. Lovat’s son by the subject of
this notice&mdash;the Honourable Archibald Campbell Fraser&mdash;was a
boy at Petty school in 1745. The President sometimes invited
him to dinner. One day, pulling a handful of foreign gold pieces
out of his pocket, he carelessly asked the boy if he had ever seen
such coins before. Here was a stroke worthy of Lovat himself,
for undoubtedly he meant thus to be informed whether the lord
of Castle Downie was accustomed to get remittances for the
Chevalier’s cause from abroad.</p>

<p>After the death of Lord Lovat, there arose some demur about
his lady’s jointure, which was only £190 per annum. It was not
paid to her for several years, during which, being destitute of
other resources, she lived with one of her sisters. Some of her
numerous friends&mdash;among the rest, Lord Strichen&mdash;offered her the
loan of money to purchase a house and suffice for present maintenance.
But she did not choose to encumber herself with debts
which she had no certain prospect of repaying. At length the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
dispute about her jointure was settled in a favourable manner,
and her ladyship received in a lump the amount of past dues,
out of which she expended £500 in purchasing a house at the
head of Blackfriars Wynd,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and a further sum upon a suite of
plain substantial furniture.</p>

<p>It would surprise a modern dowager to know how much good
Lady Lovat contrived to do amongst her fellow-creatures with
this small allowance. It is said that the succeeding Lady of
Lovat, with a jointure of £4000, was less distinguished for her
benefactions. In Lady Lovat’s dusky mansion, with a waiting-maid,
cook, and footboy, she not only maintained herself in the
style of a gentlewoman, but could welcome every kind of Highland
cousin to a plain but hospitable board, and even afford permanent
shelter to several unfortunate friends. A certain Lady Dorothy
Primrose, who was her niece, lived with her for several years,
using the best portion of her house, namely, the rooms fronting
the High Street, while she herself was contented with the duller
apartments towards the <em>wynd</em>. There was another desolate old
person, styled Mistress of Elphinstone, whom Lady Lovat supported
as a friend and equal for many years. Not by habit a
card-player herself, she would make up a whist-party every week
for the benefit of <em>the Mistress</em>. At length the poor Mistress came
to a sad fate. A wicked, perhaps half-crazy boy, grandson to
her ladyship, having taken an antipathy to his venerable relative,
put poison into the oatmeal porridge which she was accustomed
to take at supper. Feeling unwell that night, she did not eat
any, and the Mistress took the porridge instead, of which she
died. The boy was sent away, and died in obscurity.</p>

<p>An unostentatious but sincere piety marked the character of
Lady Lovat. Perhaps her notions of Providence were carried
to the verge of a kind of fatalism; for not merely did she receive
all crosses and troubles as trials arranged for her benefit by a
Higher Hand, but when a neighbouring house on one occasion took
fire, she sat unmoved in her own mansion, notwithstanding the
entreaties of the magistrates, who ordered a sedan to be brought
for her removal. She said if her hour was come, it would be
vain to try to elude her fate; and if it was not come, she would
be safe where she was. She had a conscientiousness almost ludicrously
nice. If detained from church on any occasion, she always
doubled her usual oblation at the <em>plate</em> next time. When her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
chimney took fire, she sent her fine to the Town-guard before they
knew the circumstance. Even the tax-collector experienced her
ultra-rectitude. When he came to examine her windows, she
took him to a closet lighted by a single pane, looking into a
narrow passage between two houses. He hesitated about charging
for such a small modicum of light, but her ladyship insisted on
his taking note of it.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Lady Lovat was of small stature, had been thought a beauty,
and retained in advanced old age much of her youthful delicacy
of features and complexion. Her countenance bore a remarkably
sweet and pleasing expression. When at home, her dress was
a red silk gown, with ruffled cuffs, and sleeves puckered like a
man’s shirt; a fly-cap, encircling the head, with a mob-cap laid
across it, falling down over the cheeks, and tied under the chin;
her hair dressed and powdered; a double muslin handkerchief
round the neck and bosom; <em>lammer-beads</em>; a white lawn apron,
edged with lace; black stockings with red gushets; high-heeled
shoes.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> She usually went abroad in a chair, as I have been
informed by the daughter of a lady who was one of the first
inhabitants of the New Town, and whom Lady Lovat regularly
visited there once every three months. As her chair emerged from
the head of Blackfriars Wynd, any one who saw her sitting in it,
so neat and fresh and clean, would have taken her for a queen
in waxwork, pasted up in a glass-case.</p>

<p>Lady Lovat was intimate with Lady Jane Douglas; and one
of the strongest evidences in favour of Lord Douglas being the
son of that lady<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> was the following remarkable circumstance:
Lady Lovat, passing by a house in the High Street, saw a child
at a window, and remarked to a friend who was with her: ‘If I
thought Lady Jane Douglas could be in Edinburgh, I would say
that was her child&mdash;he is so like her!’ Upon returning home,
she found a note from Lady Jane, informing her that she had
just arrived in Edinburgh, and had taken lodgings in &mdash;&mdash; Land,
which proved to be the house in which Lady Lovat had observed
the child, and that child was young Archibald Douglas. Lady
Lovat was a person of such strict integrity that no consideration
could have tempted her to say what she did not think; and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
the time she saw the child, she had no reason to suppose that
Lady Jane was in Scotland.</p>

<p>Such was the generosity of her disposition that when her
grandson Simon was studying law, she at various times presented
him with £50, and when he was to pass as an advocate she sent
him £100. It was wonderful how she could spare such sums
from her small jointure. Whole tribes of grand-nephews and
grand-nieces experienced the goodness of her heart, and loved
her with almost filial affection. She frequently spoke to them of
her misfortunes, and was accustomed to say: ‘I dare say, bairns,
the events of my life would make a good <em>novelle</em>; but they have
been of so strange a nature that nobody would believe them’&mdash;meaning
that they wanted the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> necessary in fiction.
She contemplated the approach of death with fortitude, and in
anticipation of her obsequies, had her grave-clothes ready and
the stair whitewashed. Yet the disposal of her poor remains
little troubled her. When asked by her son if she wished to be
placed in the burial-vault at Beaufort, she said: ‘’Deed, Archie,
ye needna put yoursel’ to ony fash about me, for I dinna care
though ye lay me aneath that hearthstane!’ After all, it chanced,
from some misarrangements, that her funeral was not very promptly
executed; whereupon a Miss Hepburn of Humbie, living in a
floor above, remarked, ’she wondered what they were keeping her
sae lang for&mdash;stinkin’ a’ the stair.’ This gives some idea of circumstances
connected with Old Town life.</p>

<p>The conduct of her ladyship’s son in life was distinguished by
a degree of eccentricity which, in connection with that of his son
already stated, tends to raise a question as to the character of
Lord Lovat, and make us suspect that wickedness so great as his
could only result from a certain unsoundness of mind. It is
admitted, however, that the eldest son, Simon, who rose to be a
major-general in the army, was a man of respectable character.
He retained nothing of his father but a genius for making fine
speeches.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The late Mrs Murray of Henderland told me she was
present at a supper-party given by some gentleman in the Horse
Wynd, where General Fraser, eating his egg, said to the hostess:
‘Mrs &mdash;&mdash;, other people’s eggs overflow with <em>milk</em>; but yours
run over with <em>cream</em>!’</p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>House of Gavin Douglas the Poet&mdash;Skirmish of Cleanse-the-Causeway&mdash;College
Wynd&mdash;Birthplace of Sir Walter Scott&mdash;The Horse
Wynd&mdash;Tam o’ the Cowgate&mdash;Magdalen Chapel.</strong></p>


<p>Looking at the present state of this ancient street, it is
impossible to hear without a smile the description of it given
by Alexander Alesse about the year 1530&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi nihil est humile aut
rusticum, sed omnia magnifica!</i> (‘Where nothing is humble or
homely, but everything magnificent!’) The street was, he tells
us, that in which the nobles and judges resided, and where the
palaces of princes were situated. The idea usually entertained
of its early history is that it rose as an elegant suburb after the
year 1460, when the existing city, consisting of the High Street
alone, was enclosed in a wall. It would appear, however, that
some part of it was built before that time, and that it was in an
advanced, if not complete, state as a street not long after. It
was to enclose this esteemed suburb that the city wall was extended
after the battle of Flodden.</p>


<h3>HOUSE OF GAVIN DOUGLAS THE POET&mdash;SKIRMISH OF
CLEANSE-THE-CAUSEWAY.</h3>

<p>So early as 1449, Thomas Lauder, canon of Aberdeen, granted
an endowment of 40s. annually to a chaplain in St Giles’s
Church, ‘out of his own house lying in the Cowgaite, betwixt
the land of the Abbot of Melrose on the east, and of George
Cochrane on the west.’ This appears to have been the same
Thomas Lauder who was preceptor to James II., and who
ultimately became Bishop of Dunkeld. We are told that, besides
many other munificent acts, he purchased a lodging in Edinburgh
<em>for himself and his successors</em>.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> That its situation was the same
as that above described appears from a charter of Thomas
Cameron, in 1498, referring to a house on the south side of the
Cowgate, ‘betwixt <em>the Bishop of Dunkeld’s land on the east</em>,
and William Rappilowe’s on the west, the common street on
the north, and the gait that leads to the Kirk-of-Field on the
south.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span></p>

<p>From these descriptions we attain a tolerably distinct idea of
the site of the house of the bishops of Dunkeld in Edinburgh,
including, of course, one who is endeared to us from a peculiar
cause&mdash;Gavin Douglas, who succeeded to the see in 1516. This
house must have stood nearly opposite to the bottom of Niddry
Street, but somewhat to the eastward. It would have gardens
behind, extending up to the line of the present Infirmary Street.</p>

<p>We thus not only have the pleasure of ascertaining the
Edinburgh whereabouts of one of our most distinguished national
poets, but we can now read, with a somewhat clearer intelligence,
a remarkable chapter in the national history.</p>

<p>It was in April 1520 that the Hamiltons (the party of the
Earl of Arran), with Bethune, Archbishop of Glasgow, called an
assembly of the nobility in Edinburgh, in order to secure the
government for the earl. The rival magnate, the Earl of Angus,
soon saw danger to himself in the great crowds of the Hamilton
party which flocked into town. Indeed warlike courses seem to
have been determined on by that side. Angus sent his uncle,
the Bishop of Dunkeld, to caution them against any violence,
and to offer that he should submit to the laws if any offence
were laid to his charge. The reverend prelate, proceeding to
the place of assembly, which was in the archbishop’s house,
at the foot of Blackfriars Wynd, found the Hamilton party
obstinate. Thinking an archbishop could not or ought not to
allow strife to take place if he could help it, he appealed to
Bethune, who, however, had actually prepared for battle by
putting on armour under his rochet. ‘Upon my conscience,
my lord,’ said Bethune, ‘I know nothing of the matter,’ at the
same time striking his hand upon his breast, which caused the
armour to return a rattling sound. Douglas’s remark was simply,
‘Your conscience clatters;’ a happy pun for the occasion, clatter
being a Scotch word signifying to tell tales. Gavin then returned
to his lodging, and told his nephew that he must do his best to
defend himself with arms. ‘For me,’ he said, ‘I will go to my
chamber and pray for you.’ With our new light as to the locality
of the Bishop of Dunkeld’s lodging, we now know that Angus and
his uncle held their consultations on this occasion within fifty
yards of the house in which the Hamiltons were assembled. The
houses, in fact, nearly faced each other in the same narrow street.</p>

<p>Angus now put himself at the head of his followers, who,
though not numerous, stood in a compact body in the High
Street. They were, moreover, the favourites of the Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
citizens, who handed spears from their windows to such as were
not armed with that useful weapon. Presently the Hamiltons
came thronging up from the Cowgate, through narrow lanes,
and entering the High Street in separate streams, armed with
swords only, were at a great disadvantage. In a short time the
Douglases had cleared the streets of them, killing many, and
obliging Arran himself and his son to make their escape through
the North Loch, mounted on a coal-horse. Archbishop Bethune,
with others, took refuge in the Blackfriars’ Monastery, where he
was seized behind the altar and in danger of his life, when Gavin
Douglas, learning his perilous situation, flew to save him, and with
difficulty succeeded in his object. Here, too, local knowledge is
important. The Blackfriars’ Monastery stood where the High
School latterly was, a spot not more than a hundred yards from
the houses of both Bethune and Gavin Douglas. It would not
necessarily require more than five minutes to apprise Douglas of
Bethune’s situation, and bring him to the rescue.</p>

<p>The popular name given to this street battle is characteristic&mdash;<em>Cleanse-the-Causeway</em>.</p>


<h3>COLLEGE WYND&mdash;BIRTHPLACE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT.</h3>

<p>The old buildings of the College of Edinburgh, themselves
mean, had for their main access, in former times, only that
narrow dismal alley called the College Wynd,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> leading up from
the Cowgate. Facing down this humble lane was the gateway,
displaying a richly ornamented architrave. The wynd itself,
strange as the averment may now appear, was the abode of
many of the professors. The illustrious Joseph Black lived at
one time in a house adjacent to the College gate, on the east
side, afterwards removed to make way for North College Street.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Another floor of the same building was occupied by Mr Keith,
father of the late Sir Alexander Keith of Ravelston, Bart.; and
there did the late Lord Keith reside in his student days. There
was a tradition, but of a vague nature, that Goldsmith, when
studying at the Edinburgh University, lived in the College Wynd.</p>

Near here Sir Walter Scott was born.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_242">Page 242.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The one peculiar glory of this humble place remains to be
mentioned&mdash;its being the birthplace of Sir Walter Scott. In
the third floor of the house just described, accessible by an entry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
leading to a common stair behind,
did this distinguished person
first see the light, August
15, 1771. It was a house of
plain aspect, like many of its
old neighbours yet surviving;
its truest disadvantage, however,
being in the unhealthiness
of the situation, to which Sir
Walter himself used to attribute
the early deaths of several
brothers and sisters born before
him. When the house was required
to give way for the
public conveniency, the elder
Scott received a fair price for
his portion of it; he had previously
removed to an airier
mansion, No. 25 George Square,
where Sir Walter spent his boyhood
and youth.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250">
<img src="images/illus_p_243.jpg" width="250" height="316" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">25 George Square.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the course of a walk through
this part of the town in 1825, Sir Walter did me the honour to
point out the site of the house in which he had been born. On
his mentioning that his father had got a good price for his share
of it, in order that it might be taken down for the public convenience,
I took the liberty of jocularly expressing my belief that
more money might have been made of it, and the public certainly
<em>much more</em> gratified, if it had remained to be shown as the birthplace
of a man who had written so many popular books. ‘Ay,
ay,’ said Sir Walter, ‘that is very well; but I am afraid I should
have required to be dead first, and that would not have been so
comfortable, you know.’</p>

<p>In the transition state of the College, from old to new
buildings, the gate at the head of the wynd was shut up by
Principal Robertson, who, however, living within the walls,
found this passage convenient as an access to the town, and
used it accordingly. It became the joke of a day, that from
being the principal gate it had become only a gate for the
Principal.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span></p>

<h3>THE HORSE WYND.</h3>

<p>This alley, connecting the Cowgate with the grounds on the
south side of the town within the walls, and broad enough for a
carriage, is understood to have derived its name from an inn
which long ago existed at its head, where the Gaelic Church
long after stood. Although the name is at least as old as the
middle of the seventeenth century, none of the buildings appear
older than the middle of the eighteenth. They had all been
renewed by people desirous of the benefit of such air as was to
be had in an alley double the usual breadth. Very respectable
members of the bar were glad to have a flat in some of the tall
<em>lands</em> on the east side of the wynd.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>On the west side of the wynd, about the middle, the Earl of
Galloway had built a distinct mansion, ornamented with vases
at top. They kept a coach and six, and it was alleged that
when the countess made calls, the leaders were sometimes at
the door she was going to, when she was stepping into the
carriage at her own door. This may be called a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i>
illustration of the nearness of friends to each other in Old
Edinburgh.</p>


<h3>TAM O’ THE COWGATE.</h3>

<p>A court of old buildings, in a massive style of architecture,
existed, previous to 1829, on a spot in the Cowgate now occupied
by the southern piers of George IV. Bridge. In the middle of
the last century it was used as the Excise-office; but even this
was a kind of declension from its original character. It is certain
that the celebrated Thomas Hamilton, first Earl of Haddington,
President of the Court of Session, and Secretary of State for
Scotland, lived here at the end of the sixteenth century, renting
the house from Macgill of Rankeillour.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> This distinguished
person, from the circumstance of his living here, was endowed
by his master, King James, with the nickname of <span class="smcap">Tam o’ the
Cowgate</span>, under which title he is now better remembered than
by any other.</p>

<p>The earl, who had risen through high legal offices to the
peerage, and who was equally noted for his penetration as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
judge, his industry as a collector of decisions, and his talent for
amassing wealth, was one evening, after a day’s hard labour in
the public service, solacing himself with a friend over a flask of
wine in his house in the Cowgate<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>&mdash;attired, for his better ease,
in a nightgown, cap, and slippers&mdash;when he was suddenly
disturbed by a great hubbub which arose under his window in
the street. This soon turned out to be a <em>bicker</em> between the
High School youths and those of the College; and it also
appeared that the latter, fully victorious, were, notwithstanding
a valiant defence, in the act of driving their antagonists before
them. The Earl of Haddington’s sympathies were awakened
in favour of the retiring party, for he had been brought up at
the High School, and going thence to complete his education at
Paris, had no similar reason to affect the College. He therefore
sprang up, dashed into the street, sided with and rallied the
fugitives, and took a most animated share in the combat that
ensued, so that finally the High School youths, acquiring fresh
strength and valour at seeing themselves befriended by the prime
judge and privy-councillor of their country (though not in his
most formidable habiliments), succeeded in turning the scale of
victory upon the College youths, in spite of their superior individual
ages and strength. The earl, who assumed the command
of the party, and excited their spirits by word as well as action,
was not content till he had pursued the Collegianers
through the Grassmarket, and out at the West Port,
the gate of which he locked against their return, thus
compelling them to spend the night in the suburbs
and the fields. He then returned home in triumph to
his castle of comfort in
the Cowgate, and resumed
the enjoyment of his friend
and flask. We can easily
imagine what a rare jest
this must have been for
King Jamie.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

<p>When this monarch visited Scotland in 1617, he found the
old statesman very rich, and was informed that the people
believed him to be in possession of the Philosopher’s Stone;
there being no other feasible mode of accounting for his
immense wealth, which rather seemed the effect of supernatural
agency than of worldly prudence or talent. King James, quite
tickled with the idea of the Philosopher’s Stone, and of so
enviable a talisman having fallen into the hands of a Scottish
judge, was not long in letting his friend and gossip know of the
story which he had heard respecting him. The Lord President
immediately invited the king, and the rest of the company
present, to come to his house next day, when he would both do
his best to give them a good dinner and lay open to them the
mystery of the Philosopher’s Stone. This agreeable invitation
was of course accepted; and the next day saw his Cowgate
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">palazzo</i> thronged with king and courtiers, all of whom the
President feasted to their hearts’ content. After dinner the
king reminded him of his Philosopher’s Stone, and expressed
his anxiety to be speedily made acquainted with so rare a
treasure, when the pawky lord addressed His Majesty and the
company in a short speech, concluding with this information,
that his whole secret lay in two simple and familiar maxims&mdash;‘Never
put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day; nor
ever trust to another’s hand what your own can execute.’ He
might have added, from the works of an illustrious contemporary:</p>

<p class="center">‘This is the only witchcraft I have used;’</p>

<p>and none could have been more effectual.</p>

<p>A ludicrous idea is obtained from the following anecdote of
the estimation in which the wisdom of the Earl of Haddington
was held by the king, and at the same time, perhaps, of that
singular monarch’s usual mode of speech. It must be understood,
by way of prefatory illustration, that King James, who
was the author of the earl’s popular appellation, ‘<em>Tam o’ the
Cowgate</em>,’ had a custom of bestowing such ridiculous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquets</i>
on his principal councillors and courtiers. Thus he conferred
upon that grave and sagacious statesman, John, Earl of Mar,
the nickname <em>Jock o’ Sklates</em>&mdash;probably in allusion to some
circumstance which occurred in their young days when they
were the fellow-pupils of Buchanan. On hearing of a meditated
alliance between the Haddington and Mar families, His Majesty
exclaimed, betwixt jest and earnest: ‘The Lord hand a grup <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>o’
me! If Tam o’ the Cowgate’s son marry Jock o’ Sklates’s
daughter, what’s to come o’ <em>me</em>?’ The good-natured monarch
probably apprehended that so close a union betwixt two of his
most subtle statesmen might make them too much for their
master&mdash;as hounds are most dangerous when they hunt in couples.</p>

<p>The Earl of Haddington died in 1637, full of years and
honours. At Tyningham, the seat of his family, there are two
portraits of his lordship, one a half-length, the other a head; as
also his state-dress; and it is a circumstance too characteristic
to be overlooked that in the crimson-velvet breeches there are
no fewer than <em>nine pockets</em>! Among many of the earl’s papers
which remain in Tyningham House, one contains a memorandum
conveying a curious idea of the way in which public
and political affairs were then managed in Scotland. The
paper details the heads of a petition in his own handwriting to
the Privy Council, and at the end is a note ‘to <em>gar</em> [that is,
make] the chancellor’ do something else in his behalf.</p>

<p>A younger son of Tam o’ the Cowgate was a person of much
ingenuity, and was popularly known, for what reason I cannot
tell, by the nickname of ‘Dear Sandie Hamilton.’ He had
a foundry in the Potterrow, where he fabricated the cannon
employed in the first Covenanting war in 1639. This artillery,
be it remarked, was not formed exclusively of metal. The
greater part of the composition was leather; and yet, we are
informed, they did some considerable execution at the battle of
Newburnford, above Newcastle (August 28, 1640), where the
Scots drove a large advanced party of Charles I.’s troops before
them, thereby causing the king to enter into a new treaty. The
cannon, which were commonly called ‘Dear Sandie’s Stoups,’
were carried in swivel fashion between two horses.</p>

<p>The Excise-office had been removed, about 1730, from the
Parliament Square to the house occupied many years before
by Tam o’ the Cowgate. It afforded excellent accommodations
for this important public office. The principal room on the
second floor, towards the Cowgate, was a very superb one,
having a stucco ceiling divided into square compartments, each
of which contained some elegant device. To the rear of the
house was a bowling-green, which the Commissioners of Excise
let on lease to a person of the name of Thomson. In those
days bowling was a much more prevalent amusement than now,
being chiefly a favourite with the graver order of the citizens.
There were then no fewer than three bowling-greens in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
grounds around Heriot’s Hospital; one in the Canongate, near
the Tolbooth; another on the opposite side of the street; another
immediately behind the palace of Holyrood House, where the Duke
of York used to play when in Scotland; and perhaps several others
scattered about the outskirts of the town. The arena behind the
Excise-office was called Thomson’s Green, from the name of the
man who kept it; and it may be worth while to remind the reader
that it is alluded to in that pleasant-spirited poem by Allan
Ramsay, in imitation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vides ut alta</i> of Horace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Driving their ba’s frae whins or tee,</div>

<div class="verse">Nor doucer folk wysing a-jee</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The byas bowls on Tamson’s green.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The green was latterly occupied by the relict of this Thomson;
and among the bad debts on the Excise books, all of which are
yearly brought forward and enumerated, there still stands a sum
of something more than six pounds against Widow Thomson,
being the last half-year’s rent of <em>the green</em>, which the poor woman
had been unable to pay. The north side of Brown’s Square was
built upon part of this space of ground; the rest remained a
vacant area for the recreation of the people dwelling in Merchant
Street, until the erection of the bridge, which has overrun that, as
well as every other part of the scene of this article.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<h2><a name="ST_CECILIAS_HALL" id="ST_CECILIAS_HALL">ST CECILIA’S HALL.</a></h2>


<p>Few persons now living (1847) recollect the elegant concerts
that were given many years ago in what is now an obscure
part of our ancient city, known by the name of St Cecilia’s Hall.
They did such honour to Edinburgh, nearly for half a century,
that I feel myself called on to make a brief record of them, and
am glad to be enabled to do so by a living authority, one of the
most fervent worshippers in the temple of the goddess. Hear,
then, his last <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">aria parlante</i> on this interesting theme.</p>

<div class="figcenter w275">
<img src="images/illus_p_249.jpg" width="275" height="314" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">St Cecilia’s Hall.</p></div>
</div>

<p>‘The concerts of St Cecilia’s Hall formed one of the most
liberal and attractive amusements that any city in Europe could
boast of. The hall was built on
purpose at the foot of Niddry’s
Wynd, by a number of public-spirited
noblemen and gentlemen;
and the expense of the
concerts was defrayed by about
two hundred subscribers paying
two or three guineas each annually;
and so respectable was
the institution considered, that
upon the death of a member
there were generally several
applications for the vacancy, as
is now the case with the Caledonian
Hunt. The concerts
were managed by a governor
and a set of six or more
directors, who engaged the performers&mdash;the
principal ones from Italy, one or two from Germany,
and the rest of the orchestra was made up of English and native
artists. The concerts were given weekly during most of the time
that I attended; the instrumental music consisting chiefly of the
concertos of Corelli and Handel, and the overtures of Bach, Abel,
Stamitz, Vanhall, and latterly of Haydn and Pleyel; for at that
time, and till a good many years after, the magnificent symphonies
of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, which now form the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
attractive portions of all public concerts, had not reached this
country. Those truly grand symphonies do not seem likely to be
superseded by any similar compositions for a century to come,
transcending so immensely, as they do, all the orchestral compositions
that ever before appeared; yet I must not venture to
prophesy, when I bear in mind what a powerful influence fashion
and folly exercise upon music, as well as upon other objects of
taste. When the overtures and quartettes of Haydn first found
their way into this country, I well remember with what coldness
the former were received by most of the grave Handelians, while
at the theatres they gave delight. The old concert gentlemen
said that his compositions wanted the solidity and full harmony
of Handel and Corelli; and when the celebrated leader&mdash;the elder
Cramer&mdash;visited St Cecilia’s Hall, and played a spirited charming
overture of Haydn’s, an old amateur next to whom I was seated
asked me: “Whase music is that, now?” “Haydn’s, sir,” said I.
“Poor new-fangled stuff,” he replied; “I hope I shall never hear
it again!” Many years have since rolled away, and mark what
some among us now say: A friend, calling lately on an old lady
much in the fashionable circle of society, heard her give directions
to the pianist who was teaching her nieces to bring them some
new and fashionable pieces of music, but no more of the <em>unfashionable</em>
compositions of Haydn! Alas for those ladies whose taste in
music is regulated by fashion, and who do not know that the
music of Haydn is the admiration and delight of all the real
lovers and judges of the art in Europe!</p>

<p>‘The vocal department of our concerts consisted chiefly of the
songs of Handel, Arne, Gluck, Sarti, Jornelli, Guglielmi, Paisiello,
Scottish songs, &amp;c.; and every year, generally, we had an oratorio
of Handel performed, with the assistance of a principal bass
and a tenor singer, and a few chorus-singers from the English
cathedrals; together with some Edinburgh amateurs,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> who cultivated
that sacred and sublime music; Signor and Signora
Domenico Corri, the latter our <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</i>, singing most of the
principal songs, or most interesting portions of the music. On
such occasions the hall was always crowded to excess by a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
assemblage, including all the beauty and fashion of our city. A
supper to the directors and their friends at Fortune’s Tavern
generally followed the oratorio, where the names of the chief
beauties who had graced the hall were honoured by their healths
being drunk: the champion of the lady whom he proposed as his
toast being sometimes challenged to maintain the pre-eminence of
her personal charms by the admirer of another lady filling a glass
of double depth to her health, and thus forcing the champion of
the first lady to <em>say more</em> by drinking a still deeper bumper in
honour of her beauty; and if this produced a rejoinder from the
other, by his seizing and quaffing the cup of <em>largest</em> calibre, there
the contest generally ended, and the deepest drinker <em>saved</em> his
lady, as it was phrased, although he might have had some difficulty
in saving himself from a flooring while endeavouring to regain his
seat.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Miss Burnet of Monboddo and Miss Betsy Home, reigning
beauties of the time, were said more than once to have been the
innocent cause of the fall of man in this way. The former was
gifted with a countenance of heavenly sweetness and expression,
which Guido, had he beheld it, would have sought to perpetuate
upon canvas as that of an angel; while the other lady, quite
piquant and brilliant, might have sat to Titian for a Hebe or one
of the Graces. Miss Burnet died in the bloom of youth, universally
regretted both for her personal charms and the rare endowments
of her mind. Miss Home was happily married to Captain Brown,
her ardent admirer, who had made her his <em>toast</em> for years, and
vowed he would continue to do so till he toasted her <em>Brown</em>.
This sort of exuberant loyalty to beauty was by no means uncommon
at the convivial meetings of those days, when “time had
not thinned our flowing hair, nor bent us with his iron hand.”</p>

<p>‘Let me call to mind a few of those whose lovely faces at the
concerts gave us the sweetest zest for the music. Miss Cleghorn
of Edinburgh, still living in single-blessedness; Miss Chalmers of
Pittencrief, who married Sir William Miller of Glenlee, Bart.; Miss
Jessie Chalmers of Edinburgh, who was married to Mr Pringle of
Haining; Miss Hay of Hayston, who married Sir William Forbes
of Pitsligo, Bart.; Miss Murray of Lintrose, who was called the
<em>Flower of Strathmore</em>, and upon whom Burns wrote the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Blithe, blithe, and merry was she,</div>
<div class="verse">Blithe was she but and ben;</div>
<div class="verse">Blithe by the banks of the Earn,</div>
<div class="verse">And blithe in Glenturit Glen.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span></p>
<p>She married David Smith, Esq. of Methven, one of the Lords of
Session; Miss Jardine of Edinburgh, who married Mr Home
Drummond of Blairdrummond&mdash;their daughter, if I mistake not,
is now the Duchess of Athole; Miss Kinloch of Gilmerton, who
married Sir Foster Cunliffe of Acton, Bart.; Miss Lucy Johnston
of East Lothian, who married Mr Oswald of Auchincruive; Miss
Halket of Pitferran, who became the wife of the celebrated Count
Lally-Tollendal; and Jane, Duchess of Gordon, celebrated for her
wit and spirit, as well as for her beauty. These, with Miss Burnet
and Miss Home, and many others whose names I do not distinctly
recollect, were indisputably worthy of all the honours conferred
upon them. But beauty has tempted me to digress too long from
my details relative to the hall and its concerts, to which I return.</p>

<p>‘The hall [built in 1762 from a design of Mr Robert Mylne,
after the model of the great opera theatre of Parma] was an
exact oval, having a concave elliptical ceiling, and was remarkable
for the clear and perfect conveyance of sounds, without
responding echoes, as well as for the judicious manner in which
the seating was arranged. In this last respect, I have seen no
concert-room equal to it either in London or Paris. The orchestra
was erected at the upper end of the hall, opposite to the door of
entrance; a portion of the area, in the centre or widest part, was
without any seats, and served as a small promenade, where friends
could chat together during the intervals of performance. The
seats were all <em>fixed</em> down on both sides of the hall, and each side
was raised by a gradual elevation from the level area, backward,
the rows of seats behind each other, till they reached a passage a
few feet broad, that was carried quite round the hall behind the
last of the elevated seats; so that when the audience was seated,
each half of it fronted the other&mdash;an arrangement much preferable
to that commonly adopted, of placing all the seats upon a <em>level</em>
behind each other, for thus the whole company must look one way,
and see each other’s <em>backs</em>. A private staircase at the upper end
of the hall, not seen by the company, admitted the musicians into
the orchestra; in the front of which stood a harpsichord, with
the singers, and the principal violoncellist; and behind these, on
a platform a little elevated, were the violins, and other stringed
and wind instruments, just behind which stood a noble organ.
The hall, when filled, contained an audience of about four hundred.
No money was taken for admission, tickets being given gratis to
the lovers of music, and to strangers. What a pity that such a
liberal and gratifying institution should have ceased to exist!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
But after the New Town arose, the Old was deserted by the upper
classes: the hall was too small for the increased population, and
concerts were got up at the Assembly Rooms and Corri’s Rooms
by the professional musicians, and by Corri himself. Now a
capacious Music Hall is erected behind the Assembly Rooms,
where a pretty good subscription concert is carried on; and from
the increased facility of intercourse between Paris, London, and
Edinburgh, it seems probable that concerts by artists of the
highest talents will ere long be set on foot in Edinburgh in this
fine hall, diversified sometimes by oratorios or Italian operas.</p>

<p>‘Before concluding this brief memoir of St Cecilia’s Hall
Concerts, I shall mention the chief performers who gave attractions
to them. These were Signor and Signora Domenico Corri, from
Rome; he with a falsetto voice, which he managed with much
skill and taste; the signora with a fine, full-toned, flexible soprano
voice. Tenducci, though not one of the band, nor resident among
us, made his appearance occasionally when he came to visit the
Hopetoun family, his liberal and steady patrons; and while he
remained he generally gave some concerts at the hall, which made
quite a sensation among the musicals. I considered it a jubilee
year whenever Tenducci arrived, as no singer I ever heard sang
with more expressive simplicity, or was more efficient, whether he
sang the classical songs of Metastasio, or those of Arne’s <cite>Artaxerxes</cite>,
or the simple melodies of Scotland. To the latter he gave such
intensity of interest by his impassioned manner, and by his clear
enunciation of the words, as equally surprised and delighted us.
I never can forget the pathos and touching effect of his <cite>Gilderoy</cite>,
<cite>Lochaber no more</cite>, <cite>The Braes of Ballenden</cite>, <cite>I’ll never leave thee</cite>,
<cite>Roslin Castle</cite>, &amp;c. These, with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Verdi prati</i> of Handel, <cite>Fair
Aurora</cite> from Arne’s <cite>Artaxerxes</cite>, and Gluck’s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che faro</i>, were above
all praise. Miss Poole, Mr Smeaton, Mr Gilson, and Mr Urbani
were also for a time singers at the hall&mdash;chiefly of English and
Scottish songs.</p>

<p>‘In the instrumental department we had Signor Puppo, from
Rome or Naples, as leader and violin concerto player, a most
capital artist; Mr Schetky, from Germany, the principal violoncellist,
and a fine solo concerto player; Joseph Reinagle, a very
clever violoncello and viola player; Mr Barnard, a very elegant
violinist; Stephen Clarke, an excellent organist and harpsichord
player; and twelve or fifteen violins, basses, flutes, violas, horns,
and clarionets, with extra performers often from London. Upon
the resignation of Puppo, who charmed all hearers, Stabilini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
succeeded him, and held the situation till the institution was at
an end: he had a good round tone, though, to my apprehension,
he did not exceed mediocrity as a performer.</p>

<p>‘But I should be unpardonable if I omitted to mention the
most accomplished violin-player I ever heard, Paganini only
excepted&mdash;I mean Giornovicki, who possessed in a most extraordinary
degree the various requisites of his beautiful art:
execution peculiarly brilliant, and finely articulated as possible;
a tone of the richest and most exquisite quality; expression of
the utmost delicacy, grace, and tenderness; and an animation
that commanded your most intense and eager attention. Paganini
did not appear in Edinburgh till [thirty years] after the hall was
closed. There, as well as at private parties, I heard Giornovicki
often, and always with no less delight than I listened to Paganini.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Both, if I may use the expression, threw their whole hearts and
souls into their Cremonas, bows, and fingers.</p>

<p>Stabilini, to whom our dear G. T. refers, and who died in 1815,
much broken down by dissipation, was obliged, against his will, to
give frequent attendance at the private concerts of one of these
gentlemen performers, where Corelli’s trios were in great vogue.
There was always a capital supper afterwards, at which Stab (so
he was familiarly called) ate and drank for any two. A waggish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
friend, who knew his opinion of Edinburgh amateurs, meeting him
next day, would ask: ‘Well, Mr Stabilini, what sort of music had
you the other night at &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;’s?’</p>

<p>‘Vera good soaper, sir; vera good soaper!’</p>

<p>‘But tell us the verse you made about one of these parties.’</p>

<p>Stabilini, twitching up his shirt-collar, a common trick of his,
would say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A piece ov toarkey for a hungree bellee</div>
<div class="verse">Is moatch sup<em>eer</em>ior to Corelli!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The accent, the manner, the look with which this was delivered, is
said to have been beyond expression rich.</p>

<p>It is quite remarkable, when we consider the high character of
the popular melodies, how late and slow has been the introduction
of a taste for the higher class of musical compositions into Scotland.
The Earl of Kelly, a man of yesterday, was the first Scotsman who
ever composed music for an orchestra.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> This fact seems sufficient.
It is to be feared that the beauty of the melodies is itself partly to
be blamed for the indifference to higher music. There is too great
a disposition to rest with the distinction thus conferred upon the
nation; too many are content to go no further for the enjoyments
which music has to give. It would be well if, while not forgetting
those beautiful simple airs, we were more generally to open our
minds to the still richer charms of the German and the Italian
muses.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MURDER_OF_DARNLEY" id="THE_MURDER_OF_DARNLEY">THE MURDER OF DARNLEY.</a></h2>


<p>While this event is connected with one of the most problematical
points in our own history, or that of any other
nation, it chances that the whole topography of the affair is very
distinctly recorded. We know not only the exact spot where the
deed was perpetrated, but almost every foot of the ground over
which the perpetrators walked on their way to execute it. It is
chiefly by reason of the depositions and confessions brought out
by the legal proceedings against the inferior instruments that this
minute knowledge is attained.</p>

<p>The house in which the unfortunate victim resided at the time
was one called the Prebendaries’ Chamber, being part of the suite
of domestic buildings connected with the collegiate church of
St-Mary-in-the-Fields (usually called the <em>Kirk o’ Field</em>). Darnley
was brought to lodge here on the 30th of January 1566-7. He
had contracted the smallpox at Glasgow, and it was thought
necessary, or pretended to be thought necessary, to lodge him in
this place for air, as also to guard against infecting the infant
prince, his son, who was lodged in Holyrood House. The house,
which then belonged, by gift, to a creature of the Earl of Bothwell,
has been described as so very mean as to excite general surprise.
Yet, speaking by comparison, it does not appear to have been a
bad temporary lodging for a person in Darnley’s circumstances.
It consisted of two stories, with a <em>turnpike</em> or spiral staircase
behind. The gable adjoined to the town-wall, which there ran in
a line east and west, and the cellar had a postern opening through
that wall. In the upper floor were a chamber and closet, with a
little gallery having a window also through the town-wall.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
Darnley was deposited in an old purple travelling-bed. Underneath
his room was an apartment in which the queen slept for one
or two nights before the murder took place. On the night of
Sunday, February 9, she was attending upon her husband in his
sick-room, when the servants of the Earl of Bothwell deposited the
powder in her room, immediately under the king’s bed. The
queen afterwards took her leave, in order to attend the wedding of
two of her servants at the palace.</p>

<p>It appears, from the confessions of the wretches executed for
this foul deed, that as they returned from depositing the powder
they saw ‘the Queenes grace gangand before thame with licht
torches up the Black Frier Wynd.’ On their returning to Bothwell’s
lodging at the palace, that nobleman prepared himself for
the deed by changing his gay suit of ‘hose, stockit with black
velvet, passemented with silver, and doublett of black satin of the
same maner,’ for ‘ane uther pair of black hose,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and ane canvas
doublet white, and tuke his syde [long] riding-cloak about him, of
sad English claith, callit the new colour.’ He then went, attended
by Paris, the queen’s servant, Powry, his own porter, Pate Wilson,
and George Dalgleish, ‘downe the turnepike altogedder, and along
the bak of the Queene’s garden, till you come to the bak of the
cunyie-house [mint], and the bak of the stabbillis, till you come to
the Canongate fornent the Abbey zett.’ After passing up the
Canongate, and gaining entry with some difficulty by the Netherbow
Port, ‘thai gaid up abone Bassentyne’s hous on the south side
of the gait,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and knockit at ane door beneath the sword slippers,
and callit for the laird of Ormistounes, and one within answerit he
was not thair; and thai passit down a cloiss beneath the Frier
Wynd [<em>apparently Toddrick’s Wynd</em>], and enterit in at the zett of
the Black Friers, till thay came to the back wall and dyke of the
town-wall, whair my lord and Paris past in over the wall.’ The
explosion took place soon after, about two in the morning. The
earl then came back to his attendants at this spot, and ‘thai past
all away togidder out at the Frier zett, and sinderit in the Cowgait.’
It is here evident that the alley now called the High School
Wynd was the avenue by which the conspirators approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
the scene of their atrocity. Bothwell himself, with part of his
attendants, went up the same wynd ‘be east the Frier Wynd,’ and
crossing the High Street, endeavoured to get out of the city by
leaping a broken part of the town-wall in Leith Wynd, but finding
it too high, was obliged to rouse once more the porter at the
Netherbow. They then passed&mdash;for every motion of the villains
has a strange interest&mdash;down St Mary’s Wynd, and along the south
back of the Canongate to the earl’s lodgings in the palace.</p>

<p>The house itself, by this explosion, was destroyed, ‘<em>even</em>,’ as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
queen tells in a letter to her ambassador in France, ‘<em>to the very
grund-stane</em>.’ The bodies of the king and his servant were found
next morning in a garden or field on the outside of the town-wall.
The buildings connected with the Kirk o’ Field were afterwards
converted into the College of King James, now our Edinburgh
University. The hall of the Senatus in the new buildings occupies
nearly the exact site of the Prebendaries’ Chamber, the ruins of
which are laid down in De Witt’s map of 1648.</p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>The Mint&mdash;Robert Cullen&mdash;Lord Chancellor Loughborough.</strong></p>


<p>The <em>Cunyie House</em>, as the Scottish Mint used to be called, was
near Holyrood Palace in the days of Queen Mary. In the
regency of Morton a large house was erected for it in the Cowgate,
where it may still be seen,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> with the following inscription over the

</p>

<p>In the reign of Charles II. other buildings were added behind,
forming a neat quadrangle; and here was the Scottish coin
produced till the Union, when a separate coinage was given up
and this establishment abandoned; though, to gratify prejudice,
the offices were still kept up as sinecures. This court with its
buildings was a sanctuary for persons prosecuted for debt, as was
the King’s Stables, a mean place at the west end of the Grassmarket.
There was, however, a small den near the top of the
oldest building, lighted by a small window looking up the Cowgate,
which was used as a jail for debtors or other delinquents condemned
by the Mint’s own officers.</p>

<p>In the western portion of the old building, accessible by a stair
from the court, is a handsome room with an alcove ceiling, and
lighted by two handsomely proportioned windows, which is known
to have been the council-room of the Mint, being a portion of the
private mansion of the master. Here, in May 1590, on a Sunday
evening, the town of Edinburgh entertained the Danish lords who
accompanied James VI. and his queen from her native court&mdash;namely,
Peter Monk, the admiral of Denmark; Stephen Brahe,
captain of Eslinburg [perhaps a relative of Tycho?]; Braid Ransome
Maugaret; Nicholaus Theophilus, Doctor of Laws; Henry
Goolister, captain of Bocastle; William Vanderwent; and some
others. For this banquet, ‘maid in Thomas Aitchinsoune, master
of the cunyie-house lugeing,’ it was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span> ‘that the thesaurer
caus by and lay in foure punsheouns wyne; John Borthuik baxter
to get four bunnis of beir, with foure gang of aill, and to furneis
breid; Henry Charteris and Roger Macnacht to caus hing the
hous with tapestrie, set the burdis, furmis, chandleris [<em>candlesticks</em>],
and get flowris; George Carketill and Rychert Doby to provyde
the cupbuirds and men to keep thame; and my Lord Provest was
content to provyde naprie and twa dozen greit veschell, and to
avance ane hunder pund or mair, as thai sall haif a do.’</p>

<p>In the latter days of the Mint as an active establishment, the
coining-house was in the ground-floor of the building, on the north
side of the court; in the adjoining house, on the east side, was the
finishing-house, where the money was polished and fitted for circulation.
The chief instruments used in coining were a hammer
and steel dies, upon which the device was engraved. The metal,
being previously prepared of the proper fineness and thickness, was
cut into longitudinal slips, and a square piece being cut from the
slip, it was afterwards rounded and adjusted to the weight of the
money to be made. The blank pieces of metal were then placed
between two dies, and the upper one was struck with a hammer.
After the Restoration another method was introduced&mdash;that of
the mill and screw, which, modified by many improvements, is
still in use. At the Union, the ceremony of destroying the dies of
the Scottish coinage took place in the Mint. After being heated
red-hot in a furnace, they were defaced by three impressions of a
broad-faced <em>punch</em>, which were of course visible on the dies as long
as they existed; but it must be recorded that all these implements,
which would now have been great curiosities, are lost, and none of
the machinery remains but the press, which, weighing about half a
ton, was rather too large to be readily appropriated, or perhaps it
would have followed the rest.</p>

<p>The floors over the coining-house&mdash;bearing the letters, <span class="smcap lowercase">C. R. II.</span>,
surmounting a crown, and the legend, <span class="smcap lowercase">GOD SAVE THE KING, 1674</span>,
originally the mansion of the master&mdash;were latterly occupied by the
eminent Dr Cullen, whose family were all born here, and who died
here himself in 1792.</p>


<h3>ROBERT CULLEN.</h3>

<p>Robert Cullen, the son of the physician, made a great impression
on Edinburgh society by his many delightful social qualities, and
particularly his powers as a mimic of the Mathews genus. He
manifested this gift in his earliest years, to the no small discomposure
of his grave old father. One evening, when Dr Cullen was
going to the theatre, Robert entreated to be taken along with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
but for some reason was condemned to remain at home. Some
time after the departure of the doctor, Mrs Cullen heard him come
along the passage, as if from his own room, and say at her door:
‘Well, after all, you may let Robert go.’ Robert was accordingly
allowed to depart for the theatre, where his appearance gave no
small surprise to his father. On the old gentleman coming home
and remonstrating with his lady for allowing the boy to go, it was
discovered that the voice which seemed to give the permission had
proceeded from the young wag himself.</p>

<p>In maturer years, Cullen could not only mimic any voice or
mode of speech, but enter so thoroughly into the nature of any
man that he could supply exactly the ideas which he was likely
to use. His imitations were therefore something much above
mimicries&mdash;they were artistic representations of human character.
He has been known in a social company, where another individual
was expected, to stand up, in the character of that person, and
return thanks for the proposal of his health; and this was done
so happily that when the individual did arrive and got upon his
legs to speak for himself, the company was convulsed with an
almost exact repetition of what Cullen had previously uttered, the
manner also and every inflection of the voice being precisely alike.
In relating anecdotes, of which he possessed a vast store, he usually
prefaced them with a sketch of the character of the person referred
to, which greatly increased the effect, as the story then told characteristically.
These sketches were remarked to be extremely
graphic and most elegantly expressed.</p>

<p>When a young man, residing with his father, he was very
intimate with Dr Robertson, the Principal of the university. To
show that Robertson was not likely to be easily imitated, it may
be mentioned, from the report of a gentleman who has often heard
him making public orations, that when the students observed him
pause for a word, and would themselves mentally supply it, they
invariably found that the word which he did use was different from
that which they had hit upon. Cullen, however, could imitate
him to the life, either in his more formal speeches or in his
ordinary discourse. He would often, in entering a house which
the Principal was in the habit of visiting, assume his voice in the
lobby and stair, and when arrived at the drawing-room door, astonish
the family by turning out to be&mdash;Bob Cullen. Lord Greville, a
pupil of the Principal’s, having been one night detained at a
protracted debauch, where Cullen was also present, the latter
gentleman next morning got admission to the bedroom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
young nobleman, where, personating Dr Robertson, he sat down
by the bedside, and with all the manner of the reverend Principal,
gave him a sound lecture for having been out so late last night.
Greville, who had fully expected this visit, lay in remorseful
silence, and allowed his supposed monitor to depart without saying
a word. In the course of a quarter of an hour, however, when the
real Dr Robertson entered, and commenced a harangue exactly
duplicating that just concluded, he could not help exclaiming that
it was <em>too bad</em> to give it him twice over. ‘Oh, I see how it is,’
said Robertson, rising to depart; ‘that rogue Bob Cullen must
have been with you.’ The Principal became at length accustomed
to Bob’s tricks, which he would seem, from the following anecdote,
to have regarded in a friendly spirit. Being attended during an
illness by Dr Cullen, it was found necessary to administer a liberal
dose of laudanum. The physician, however, asked him, in the first
place, in what manner laudanum affected him. Having received
his answer, Cullen remarked, with surprise, that he had never
known any one affected in the same way by laudanum besides
his son Bob. ‘Ah,’ said Robertson, ‘<em>does the rascal take me off
there too?</em>’</p>

<p>Mr Cullen entered at the Scottish bar in 1764, and, distinguishing
himself highly as a lawyer, was raised to the bench
in 1796, when he took the designation of Lord Cullen. He
cultivated elegant literature, and contributed some papers of
acknowledged merit to the <cite>Mirror</cite> and <cite>Lounger</cite>; but it was in
conversation that he chiefly shone.</p>

<p>The close adjoining to the Mint contains several old-fashioned
houses of a dignified appearance. In a floor of one bearing the
date 1679, and having a little court in front, Alexander Wedderburn,
Earl of Rosslyn and Lord Chancellor of England, resided
while at the Scottish bar. This, as is well known, was a very
brief interval; for a veteran barrister having one day used the
term ‘presumptuous boy’ with reference to him, and his own
caustic reply having drawn upon him a rebuke from the bench, he
took off his gown, and making a bow, said he would never more
plead where he was subjected to insult, but would seek a wider
field for his exertions. His subsequent rapid rise at the English
bar is matter of history. It is told that, returning to Edinburgh
at the end of his life, after an absence of many years, he wished
to see the house where he had lived while a Scotch advocate.
Too infirm to walk, he was borne in a chair to the foot of the
Mint Close to see this building. One thing he was particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
anxious about. While residing here, he had had five holes made
in the little court to play at some bowling game of which he was
fond. He wished, above all things, to see these holes once more,
and when he found they were still there, he expressed much satisfaction.
Churchill himself might have melted at such an anecdote
of the old days of him who was</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Pert at the bar, and in the senate loud.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>About midway up the close is a turreted mansion, accessible
from Hyndford’s Close, and having a tolerably good garden connected
with it. This was, in 1742, the residence of the Earl of
Selkirk; subsequently it was occupied by Dr Daniel Rutherford,
professor of botany. Sir Walter Scott, who, being a nephew of
that gentleman, was often in the house in his young days, communicated
to me a curious circumstance connected with it. It
appears that the house immediately adjacent was not furnished
with a stair wide enough to allow of a coffin being carried down
in decent fashion. It had, therefore, what the Scottish law calls
a <em>servitude</em> upon Dr Rutherford’s house, conferring the perpetual
liberty of bringing the deceased inmates through a passage into
that house and down <em>its</em> stair into the lane.</p>

<h2><a name="MISS_NICKY_MURRAY" id="MISS_NICKY_MURRAY">MISS NICKY MURRAY.</a></h2>


<p>The dancing assemblies of Edinburgh were for many years,
about the middle of the last century, under the direction and
dictatorship of the Honourable Miss Nicky Murray, one of the
sisters of the Earl of Mansfield. Much good sense, firmness,
knowledge of the world and of the histories of individuals, as well
as a due share of patience and benevolence, were required for this
office of unrecognised though real power; and it was generally
admitted that Miss Murray possessed the needful qualifications in
a remarkable degree, though rather more marked by good manners
than good-nature. She and her sisters lived for many years in a
floor of a large building at the head of Bailie Fife’s Close&mdash;a now
unhallowed locality, where, I believe, Francis Jeffrey attended his
first school. In their narrow mansion, the Miss Murrays received
flights of young lady-cousins from the country, to be finished
in their manners and introduced into society. No light task
must theirs have been, all things considered. I find a highly
significant note on the subject inserted by an old gentleman in an
interleaved copy of my first edition: ‘It was from Miss Nicky
Murray’s&mdash;a relation of the Gray family&mdash;that my father ran off
with my mother, then not sixteen years old.’</p>

<p>The Assembly Room of that time was in the <em>close</em> where the
Commercial Bank was afterwards established.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> First there was a
lobby, where chairs were disburdened of their company, and where
a reduced gentleman, with pretensions to the title of Lord Kirkcudbright&mdash;descendant
of the once great Maclellans of Galloway&mdash;might
have been seen selling gloves; this being the person alluded
to in a letter written by Goldsmith while a student in Edinburgh:
‘One day, happening to slip into Lord Kilcobry’s&mdash;don’t be surprised,
his lordship is only a glover!’ The dancing-room opened
directly from the lobby, and above stairs was a tea-room. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
former had a railed space in the centre, within which the dancers
were arranged, while the spectators sat round on the outside; and
no communication was allowed between the different sides of this
sacred pale. The lady-directress had a high chair or throne at
one end. Before Miss Nicky Murray, Lady Elliot of Minto and
Mrs Brown of Coalstoun, wives of judges, had exercised this lofty
authority, which was thought honourable on account of the
charitable object of the assemblies. The arrangements were of a
rigid character, and certainly tending to dullness. There being
but one set allowed to dance at a time, it was seldom that any
person was twice on the floor in one night. The most of the time
was spent in acting the part of lookers-on, which threw great
duties in the way of conversation upon the gentlemen. These
had to settle with a partner for the year, and were upon no
account permitted to change, even for a single night. The appointment
took place at the beginning of the season, usually at
some private party or ball given by a person of distinction, where
the fans of the ladies were all put into a gentleman’s cocked hat;
the gentlemen put in their hands and took a fan, and to whomsoever
the fan belonged, that was to be his partner for the season.
In the general rigours of this system, which sometimes produced
ludicrous combinations, there was, however, one palliative&mdash;namely,
the fans being all distinguishable from each other, and the gentleman
being in general as well acquainted with the fan as the face
of his mistress, and the hat being open, it was possible to peep
in, and exercise, to a certain extent, a principle of selection,
whereby he was perhaps successful in procuring an appointment to
his mind. All this is spiritedly given in a poem of Sir Alexander
Boswell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Then were the days of modesty of mien!</div>
<div class="verse">Stays for the fat, and quilting for the lean;</div>
<div class="verse">The ribboned stomacher, in many a plait,</div>
<div class="verse">Upheld the chest, and dignified the gait;</div>
<div class="verse">Some Venus, brightest planet of the train,</div>
<div class="verse">Moved in a lustering <em>halo</em>, propped with cane.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the <em>Assembly Close</em> received the fair&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Order and elegance presided there&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Each gay Right Honourable had her place,</div>
<div class="verse">To walk a minuet with becoming grace.</div>
<div class="verse">No racing to the dance, with rival hurry&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Such was thy sway, O famed Miss Nicky Murray!</div>
<div class="verse">Each lady’s fan a chosen Damon bore,</div>
<div class="verse">With care selected many a day before;</div>
<div class="verse">For, unprovided with a favourite beau,</div>
<div class="verse">The nymph, chagrined, the ball must needs forego;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
<div class="verse">But, previous matters to her taste arranged,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Certes</em>, the constant couple never changed;</div>
<div class="verse">Through a long night, to watch fair Delia’s will,</div>
<div class="verse">The same dull swain was at her elbow still.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A little before Miss Nicky’s time, it was customary for gentlemen
to walk alongside the chairs of their partners, with their
swords by their sides, and so escort them home. They called
next afternoon upon their Dulcineas to inquire how they were
and drink tea. The fashionable time for seeing company in those
days was the evening, when people were all abroad upon the street,
as in the forenoon now, making calls and <em>shopping</em>. The people
who attended the assemblies were very <em>select</em>. Moreover, they
were all known to each other; and the introduction of a stranger
required nice preliminaries. It is said that Miss Murray, on
hearing a young lady’s name pronounced for the first time, would
say: ‘Miss &mdash;&mdash;, of what?’ If no territorial addition could be
made, she manifestly cooled. Upon one occasion, seeing a man at
the assembly who was born in a low situation and raised to wealth
in some humble trade, she went up to him, and, without the least
deference to his fine-laced coat, taxed him with presumption in
coming there, and turned him out of the room.</p>

<p>Major Topham praises the regularity and propriety observed at
the assemblies, though gently insinuating their heaviness. He says:
‘I was never at an assembly where the authority of the manager
was so observed or respected. With the utmost politeness, affability,
and good-humour, Miss Murray attends to every one. All
petitions are heard, and demands granted, which appear reasonable.
The company is so much the more obliged to Miss Murray, as the
task is by no means to be envied. The crowd which immediately
surrounds her on entering the room, the impetuous applications
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaperons</i>, maiden-aunts, and the earnest entreaties of lovers to
obtain a ticket in one of the first sets for the dear object, render
the fatigue of the office of lady-directress almost intolerable.’<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span></p>
<p>Early hours were kept in those days, and the stinted time was
never exceeded. When the proper hour arrived for dissolving the
party, and the young people would crowd round the throne to
petition for one other set, up rose Miss Nicky in unrelenting
rigidity of figure, and with one wave of her hand silenced the
musicians:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Quick from the summit of the grove they fell,</div>
<div class="verse">And left it inharmonious.’</div>

<h2><a name="THE_BISHOPS_LAND" id="THE_BISHOPS_LAND">[THE BISHOP’S LAND.</a></h2>


<p>On the north side of the High Street, a hundred yards or so
below the North Bridge, there existed previous to 1813 an
unusually large and handsome old <em>land</em> or building named the
<em>Bishop’s Land</em>. It rested upon an arcade or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">piazza</i>, as it is called,
and the entry in the first floor bore the ordinary legend:</p>

<p class="center">
BLISSIT BE ZE LORD FOR ALL HIS GIFTIS,
</p>

<p>together with the date 1578, and a shield impaled with two coats
of arms. Along the front of this floor was a balcony composed of
brass, a thing unique in the ancient city. The house had been
the Edinburgh residence of Archbishop John Spottiswood. Most
unfortunately the whole line of building towards the street was
burned down in the year 1813.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the last century the Bishop’s Land was
regarded as a very handsome residence, and it was occupied accordingly
by persons of consideration. The dictum of an old citizen
to me many years ago was: ‘Nobody without livery-servants lived
in the Bishop’s Land.’ Sir Stuart Threipland of Fingask occupied
the first floor. His estate, forfeited by his father in 1716, was
purchased back by him, with money obtained through his wife, in
1784; and the title, which was always given to him by courtesy,
was restored as a reality to his descendants by George IV. He
had himself been engaged in the affair of 1745-6, and had accompanied
‘the Prince’ in some part of his wanderings. In the hands
of this ‘fine old <em>Scottish</em> gentleman,’ for such he was, his house
in the Bishop’s Land was elegantly furnished, there being in
particular some well-painted portraits of royal personages&mdash;<em>not
of the reigning house</em>. These had all been sent to his father and
himself by the persons represented in them, who thus showed their
gratitude for efforts made and sufferings incurred in their behalf.
There were five windows to the street, three of them lighting the
drawing-room; the remaining two lighted the eldest son’s room.
A dining-room, Sir Stuart’s bedroom, his sister Janet’s (who kept
house for him) room, and other apartments were in the rear, some
lighted from the adjacent close&mdash;and these still exist, having been
spared by the fire. The kitchen and servants’ rooms were below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p>In the next floor above lived the Hamiltons of Pencaitland; in
the next again, the Aytouns of Inchdairnie. Mrs Aytoun, who
was a daughter of Lord Rollo, would sometimes come down the
stair in a winter evening, lighting herself with a little wax-taper,
to drink tea with <em>Mrs</em> Janet Threipland, for so she called herself,
though unmarried. In the uppermost floor of all lived a reputable
tailor and his family. All the various tenants, including the
tailor, were on good neighbourly terms with each other; a pleasant
thing to tell of this bit of the old world, which has left nothing
of the same kind behind it in these later days, when we all live at
a greater distance, physical and moral, from each other.]</p>

<hr class="chap" /></div><div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="JOHN_KNOXS_MANSE" id="JOHN_KNOXS_MANSE">JOHN KNOX’S MANSE.</a></h2>


<p>The lower portion of the High Street, including <em>the Netherbow</em>,
was, till a recent time, remarkable for the antiquity of the
greater number of the buildings, insomuch that no equal portion
of the city was more distinctly a memorial of the general appearance
of the whole as it was in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. On the north side of the High Street, immediately
adjacent to the Netherbow, there was a nest of tall wooden-fronted
houses of one character, and the age of which generally
might be guessed from the date existing upon one&mdash;1562. This
formed a perfect example of the <em>High Gait</em> as it appeared to
Queen Mary, excepting that the open booths below had been
converted into close shops. The <em>fore-stairs</em>&mdash;that is, outside
stairs ascending to the <em>first floor</em> (technically so called), from
which the women of Edinburgh reviled the hapless queen as she
rode along the street after her surrender at Carberry&mdash;were
unchanged in this little district.</p>

<p>The popular story regarding houses of this kind is that they
took their origin in an inconvenience which was felt in having
the Boroughmoor covered with wood, as it proved from that
circumstance a harbour for robbers. To banish the robbers, it
was necessary to extirpate the wood. To get this done, the
magistrates granted leave to the citizens to project their house-fronts
seven feet into the street, provided they should execute
the work with timber cut from the Boroughmoor. Robert
Fergusson follows up this story in a burlesque poem by relating
how, consequently,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Edina’s mansions with lignarian art</div>
<div class="verse">Were piled and fronted. Like an ark she seemed</div>
<div class="verse">To lie on mountain’s top, with shapes replete,</div>
<div class="verse">Clean and unclean&mdash;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">To Jove the Dryads prayed, nor prayed in vain,</div>
<div class="verse">For vengeance on her sons. At midnight drear</div>
<div class="verse">Black showers descend, and teeming myriads rise</div>
<div class="verse">Of bugs abhorrent’&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The only authentic information to be obtained on the point is
presented by Maitland, when he tells us that the clearing of the
Boroughmoor of timber took place in consequence of a charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
from James IV. in 1508. He says nothing of robbers, but attributes
the permission granted by the magistrates for the making
of wooden projections merely to their desire of getting sale for
their timber. After all, I am inclined to trace this fashion
to taste. The wooden fronts appear to have originated in open
galleries&mdash;an arrangement often spoken of in early writings.
These, being closed up or formed into a range of windows, would
produce the wooden-fronted house. It is remarkable that the
wooden fronts do not in many instances bear the appearance of
afterthoughts, as the stone structure within often shows such
an arrangement of the fore wall as seems designed to connect
the projecting part with the chambers within, or to give these
chambers as much as possible of the borrowed light. At the same
time, it is somewhat puzzling to find, in the closes below the
buildings, gateways with hooks for hinges seven feet or so from
the present street-front&mdash;an arrangement which does not appear
necessary on the supposition that the houses were built designedly
with a stone interior and a wooden projection.</p>

<p>In the Netherbow the street receives a contraction from the
advance of the houses on the north side, thus closing a species
of parallelogram, of which the Luckenbooths formed the upper
extremity&mdash;the market-place of our ancient city. The uppermost
of the prominent houses&mdash;having of course two fronts
meeting in a right angle, one fronting to the line of street, the
other looking up the High Street&mdash;is pointed to by tradition as
the residence or manse of John Knox during his incumbency
as minister of Edinburgh, from 1560 till (with few interruptions)
his death in 1572. It is a picturesque building of three above-ground
floors, constructed of substantial ashlar masonry, but on
a somewhat small scale, and terminating in curious gables and
masses of chimneys. A narrow door, right in the angle, gives
access to a small room, lighted by one long window presented
to the westward, and apparently the <em>hall</em> of the mansion in
former times. Over the window and door is this legend, in an
unusually old kind of lettering:</p>

<p class="center">
LVFE·GOD·ABVFE·AL·AND·YI·NYCHTBOVR·[AS·]YI·SELF·
</p>

<p>The word ‘as’ is obliterated. The words are, in modern
English, simply the well-known scriptural command: ‘Love
God above all, and thy neighbour as thyself.’ Perched upon
the corner above the door is a small effigy of the Reformer,
preaching in a pulpit, and pointing with his right hand to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
stone above his head in that direction, which presents in rude
sculpture the sun bursting from clouds, with the name of the
Deity inscribed on his disc in three languages:</p>

<p class="center">
ΘΕΟΣ<br />
DEUS<br />
GOD<br />
</p>

<p>Dr M’Crie, in his <cite>Life of John Knox</cite>, states that the Reformer,
on commencing duty in Edinburgh at the conclusion of the
struggles with the queen-regent, ‘lodged in the house of David
Forrest, a burgess of Edinburgh, from which he removed to the
lodging which had belonged to Durie, Abbot of Dunfermline.’
The magistrates acted liberally towards their minister, giving
him a salary of two hundred pounds Scottish money, and paying
his house-rent for him, at the rate of fifteen merks yearly. In
October 1561 they ordained the Dean of Guild, ‘with al diligence,
to mak ane warm studye of dailles to the minister, Johne Knox,
within his hous, aboue the hall of the same, with lyht and
wyndokis thereunto, and all uther necessaris.’ This study is
generally supposed to have been a very small wooden projection,
of the kind described a few pages back, still seen on the front
of the <em>first floor</em>. Close to it is a window in the angle of the
building, from which Knox is said by tradition to have occasionally
held forth to multitudes below.</p>

<p>The second floor, which is accessible by two narrow spiral
stairs, one to the south, another to the west, contains a tolerably
spacious room, with a ceiling ornamented by stucco mouldings,
and a window presented to the westward. A partition has at
one time divided this room from a narrow one towards the
north, the ceiling of which is composed of the beams and
flooring of the attic flat, all curiously painted with flower-work
in an ancient taste. Two inferior rooms extend still farther to
the northward. It is to be remarked that the wooden projection
already spoken of extends up to this floor, so that there is here
likewise a small room in front; it contains a fireplace, and a
recess which might have been a cupboard or a library, besides
two small windows. That this fireplace, this recess, and also
the door by which the wooden chamber is entered from the
decorated room should all be formed in the front wall of the
house, and with a necessary relation to the wooden projection,
strikes one as difficult to reconcile with the idea of that projection
being an afterthought; the appearances rather indicate
the whole having been formed at once, as parts of one design.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
The attic floor exhibits strong oaken beams, but the flooring is
in bad order.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the house there is a small room, said by
tradition to have been used in times of difficulty for the purpose
of baptising children; there is also a well to supply the house
with water, besides a secret stair, represented as communicating
subterraneously with a neighbouring alley.</p>

<p>From the size of this house, and the variety of accesses to it,
it becomes tolerably certain that Knox could have occupied only
a portion of it. The question arises, which part did he occupy?
Probability seems decidedly in favour of the <em>first floor</em>&mdash;that
containing the window from which he is traditionally said to
have preached, and where his effigy appears. An authentic fact
in the Reformer’s life favours this supposition. When under
danger from the hostility of the queen’s party in the castle&mdash;in
the spring of 1571&mdash;‘one evening a musket-ball was fired in at
his window, and lodged in the roof of the apartment in which
he was sitting. It happened that he sat at the time in a
different part of the room from that which he had been accustomed
to occupy, otherwise the ball, from the direction it took,
must have struck him’ (M’Crie). The second floor is too high
to have admitted of a musket being fired in at one of the
windows. A ball fired in at the ground-floor would not have
struck the ceiling. The only feasible supposition in the case is
that the Reformer dwelt in the <em>first floor</em>, which was not beyond
an assassin’s aim, and yet at such a height that a ball fired from
the street would hit the ceiling.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<h2><a name="HYNDFORDS_CLOSE" id="HYNDFORDS_CLOSE">HYNDFORD’S CLOSE.</a></h2>


<p>At the bottom of the High Street, on the south side, there is
an uncommonly huge and dense mass of stone buildings or
<em>lands</em>, penetrated only by a few narrow closes. One of these is
Hyndford’s Close, a name indicating the
noble family which once had lodgment in
it. This was a Scotch peerage not without
its glories&mdash;witness particularly the
third earl, who acted as ambassador in
succession to Prussia, to Russia, and to
Vienna. It is now extinct: its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijouterie</i>,
its pictures, including portraits of Maria
Theresa, and other royal and imperial
personages, which had been presented as
friendly memorials to the ambassador,
have all been dispersed by the salesman’s
hammer, and Hyndford’s Close, on my
trying to get into it lately (1868), was
inaccessible (literally) from filth.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/illus_p_275.jpg" width="200" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hyndford’s Close.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The entry and stair at the head of the
close on the west side was a favourite
residence, on account of the ready access
to it from the street. In the second
floor of this house lived, about the beginning
of the reign of George III., Lady
Maxwell of Monreith, and there brought
up her beautiful daughters, one of whom
became Duchess of Gordon. The house
had a dark passage, and the kitchen door
was passed in going to the dining-room,
according to an agreeable old practice in
Scotch houses, which lets the guests know
on entering what they have to expect.
The fineries of Lady Maxwell’s daughters
were usually hung up, after washing, on a screen in this passage
to dry; while the coarser articles of dress, such as shifts and petticoats,
were slung decently out of sight at the window, upon a projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
contrivance similar to a dyer’s pole, of which numerous
specimens still exist at windows in the Old Town for the convenience
of the poorer inhabitants.</p>

<p>So easy and familiar were the manners of the great in those
times, fabled to be so stiff and decorous, that Miss Eglintoune,
afterwards Lady Wallace, used to be sent with the tea-kettle
across the street to the Fountain Well for water to make tea.
Lady Maxwell’s daughters were the wildest romps imaginable.
An old gentleman, who was their relation, told me that the first
time he saw these beautiful girls was in the High Street, where
Miss Jane, afterwards Duchess of Gordon, was riding upon a
sow, which Miss Eglintoune thumped lustily behind with a stick.
It must be understood that in the middle of the eighteenth
century vagrant swine went as commonly about the streets of
Edinburgh as dogs do in our own day, and were more generally
fondled as pets by the children of the last generation.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> It may,
however, be remarked that the sows upon which the Duchess
of Gordon and her witty sister rode, when children, were not
the common vagrants of the High Street, but belonged to Peter
Ramsay, of the inn in St Mary’s Wynd, and were among the
last that were permitted to roam abroad. The two romps used
to watch the animals as they were let loose in the forenoon
from the stable-yard (where they lived among the horse-litter),
and get upon their backs the moment they issued from the close.</p>

<p>The extraordinary cleverness, the genuine wit, and the delightful
<em>abandon</em> of Lady Wallace made an extraordinary impression
on Scottish society in her day. It almost seemed as if some
faculty divine had inspired her. A milliner bringing home a
cap to her when she was just about to set off to the Leith races
was so unlucky as to tear it against the buckle of a porter’s knee
in the street. ‘No matter,’ said her ladyship; and instantly
putting it on, restored all to grace by a single pin. The cap
thus misarranged was found so perfectly exquisite that ladies
tore their caps on nails, and pinned them on in the hope of
imitating it. It was, however, a grace beyond the reach of art.</p>

<p>Of the many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</i> attributed to her, one alone seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
worthy, from its being unhackneyed, of appearing here. The
son of Mr Kincaid, king’s printer&mdash;a great Macaroni, as the
phrase went; that is, dandy&mdash;was nicknamed, from his father’s
lucrative patent, <em>Young Bibles</em>. This beau entering a ballroom
one evening, some of the company asked who was that extraordinary-looking
young man. ‘Only Young Bibles,’ quoth Lady
Wallace, ‘bound in calf, and gilt, but not lettered!’</p>

<p>[In the same stair in Hyndford’s Close lived another lady of
rank, and one who, for several reasons, filled in her time a broad
space in society. This was Anne, Countess of Balcarres, the
progenitrix of perhaps as many persons as ever any woman was
in the same space of time. Her eldest daughter, Anne, authoress
of the ballad of <cite>Auld Robin Gray</cite>, was, of all her eleven children,
the one whose name is most likely to continue in remembrance&mdash;yea,
though another of them put down the Maroon war in
the West Indies. When in Hyndford’s Close, Lady Balcarres
had for a neighbour in the same alley Dr Rutherford, the uncle
of Sir Walter Scott; and young Walter, often at his uncle’s,
occasionally accompanied his aunt ‘Jeanie’ to Lady Balcarres’s.
Forty years after, having occasion to correspond with Lady
Anne Barnard, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Lindsay, he told her: ‘I remember all the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">locale</i> of Hyndford’s Close perfectly, even to the Indian screen
with Harlequin and Columbine, and the harpsichord, though I
never had the pleasure of hearing Lady Anne play upon it. I
suppose the close, once too clean to soil the hem of your
ladyship’s garment, is now a resort for the lowest mechanics&mdash;and
so wears the world away.... It is, to be sure, more
picturesque to lament the desolation of towers on hills and
haughs, than the degradation of an Edinburgh close; but I
cannot help thinking on the simple and cosie retreats where
worth and talent, and elegance to boot, were often nestled, and
which now are the resort of misery, filth, poverty, and vice.’<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The late Mrs Meetham, a younger sister of Miss Spence
Yeaman, of Murie, in the Carse of Gowrie, had often heard
her grand-aunt, Miss Molly Yeaman, describe, from her own
recollection, the tea-drinkings of the Countess of Balcarres in
Hyndford’s Close. The family was not rich, and it still retained
something of its ancient Jacobitism. The tea-drinkings, as was
not uncommon, took place in my lady’s bedroom. At the foot
of a four-posted bed, exhibiting a finely worked coverlet, stood
John, an elderly man-servant, and a <em>character</em>, in full Balcarres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
livery, an immense quantity of worsted lace on his coat.
Resting with his arm round a bedpost, he was ready to hand
the kettle when required. As the ladies went chattering on,
there would sometimes occur a difficulty about a date or a
point in genealogy, and then John was appealed to to settle the
question. For example, it came to be debated how many of the
Scotch baronetcies were real; for, as is still the case, many of
them were known to be fictitious, or assumed without legal
grounds. Here John was known to be not only learned, but
eloquent. He began: ‘Sir James Kinloch, Sir Stuart Threipland,
Sir John Wedderburn, Sir &mdash;&mdash; Ogilvy, Sir James Steuart
of Coltness’ [all of them forfeited baronets, be it observed]:
‘these, leddies, are the only <em>real</em> baronets. For the rest, I do
believe, the Deil’&mdash;&mdash;then a figurative declaration not fit for
modern print, but which made the Balcarres party only laugh,
and declare to John that they thought him not far wrong.]</p>

<p>The town mansion of the Marquises

Knox.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> When
John, the fourth

been a dwelling of
considerable importance
in the eyes of

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Scene of the Begbie Murder.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The passage from the street into Tweeddale Court is narrow
and dark, and about fifteen yards in length. Here, in 1806, when
the mansion was possessed as a banking-house by the British Linen
Company, there took place an extraordinary tragedy. About five
o’clock of the evening
of the 13th of November,
when the short
midwinter day had
just closed, a child,
who lived in a house
accessible from the
close, was sent by her
mother with a kettle
to obtain a supply of
water for tea from
the neighbouring well.
The little girl, stepping
with the kettle
in her hand out of the
public stair into the
close, stumbled in the
dark over something
which lay there, and
which proved to be the
body of a man just
expiring. On an alarm
being given, it was
discovered that this
was William Begbie, a
porter connected with
the bank, in whose
heart a knife was stuck up to the haft, so that he bled to death
before uttering a word which might tend to explain the dismal
transaction. He was at the same time found to have been robbed
of a package of notes to the value of above four thousand pounds,
which he had been entrusted, in the course of his ordinary duty,
to carry from the branch of the bank at Leith to the head-office.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
The blow had been given with an accuracy and a calculation of
consequences showing the most appalling deliberation in the
assassin; for not only was the knife directed straight into the
most vital part, but its handle had been muffled in a bunch of
soft paper, so as to prevent, as was thought, any sprinkling of
blood from reaching the person of the murderer, by which he
might have been by some chance detected. The knife was
one of those with broad thin blades and wooden handles which
are used for cutting bread, and its rounded front had been ground
to a point, apparently for the execution of this horrible deed.
The unfortunate man left a wife and four children to bewail his
loss.</p>

<p>The singular nature and circumstances of Begbie’s murder
occasioned much excitement in the public mind, and every effort
was of course made to discover the guilty party. No house of a
suspicious character in the city was left unsearched, and parties
were despatched to watch and patrol all the various roads leading
out into the country. The bank offered a reward of five hundred
pounds for such information as might lead to the conviction of
the offender or offenders; and the government further promised
the king’s pardon to any except the actual murderer who, having
been concerned in the deed, might discover their accomplices.
The sheriff of Edinburgh, Mr Clerk Rattray, displayed the
greatest zeal in his endeavours to ascertain the circumstances of
the murder, and to detect and seize the murderer, but with surprisingly
little success. All that could be ascertained was that
Begbie, in proceeding up Leith Walk on his fatal mission, had
been accompanied by ‘a man;’ and that about the supposed
time of the murder ‘a man’ had been seen by some children to
run out of the close into the street and down Leith Wynd, a
lane leading off from the Netherbow at a point nearly opposite
to the close. There was also reason to believe that the knife had
been bought in a shop about two o’clock on the day of the
murder, and that it had been afterwards ground upon a grinding-stone
and smoothed on a hone. A number of suspicious characters
were apprehended and examined; but all, with one exception, produced
satisfactory proofs of their innocence. The exception was
a carrier between Perth and Edinburgh, a man of dissolute and
irregular habits, of great bodily strength, and known to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
dangerous and desperate character. He was kept in custody for
a considerable time on suspicion, having been seen in the Canongate,
near the scene of the murder, a very short time after it was
committed. It has since been ascertained that he was then going
about a different business, the disclosure of which would have
subjected him to a capital punishment. It was in consequence
of the mystery he felt himself impelled to preserve on this subject
that he was kept so long in custody; but at length facts and
circumstances came out to warrant his discharge, and he was
discharged accordingly.</p>

<p>Months rolled on without eliciting any evidence respecting the
murder, and, like other wonders, it had ceased in a great measure
to engage public attention, when, on the 10th of August 1807,
a journeyman mason, in company with two other men, passing
through the Bellevue grounds in the neighbourhood of the city,
found, in a hole in a stone enclosure by the side of a hedge, a
parcel containing a large quantity of bank-notes, bearing the
appearance of having been a good while exposed to the weather.
After consulting a little, the men carried the package to the
sheriff’s office, where it was found to contain about £3000 in large
notes, being those which had been taken from Begbie. The
British Linen Company rewarded the men with two hundred
pounds for their honesty; but the circumstance passed without
throwing any light on the murder itself.</p>

<p>Up to the present day the murderer of Begbie has not been
discovered; nor is it probable, after the space of time which has
elapsed, that he will ever be so. It is most likely that the grave
has long closed upon him. The only person on whom public
suspicion alighted with any force during the sixteen years ensuing
upon the transaction was a medical practitioner in Leith, a dissolute
man and a gambler, who put an end to his own existence
not long after the murder. But I am not acquainted with any
particular circumstances on which this suspicion was grounded
beyond the suicide, which might spring from other causes. It was
not till 1822 that any further light was thrown on this mysterious
case. In a work then published under the title of <cite>The Life and
Trial of James Mackoull</cite>, there was included a paper by Mr
Denovan, the Bow Street officer, the object of which was to prove
that Mackoull was the murderer, and which contained at least one
very curious statement.</p>

<p>Mr Denovan had discovered in Leith a man, then acting as
a teacher, but who in 1806 was a sailor-boy, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
witnessed some circumstances immediately connected with the
murder. The man’s statement was as follows: ‘I was at that
time (November 1806) a boy of fourteen years of age. The
vessel to which I belonged had made a voyage to Lisbon, and
was then lying in Leith harbour. I had brought a small present
from Portugal for my mother and sister, who resided in the
Netherbow, Edinburgh, immediately opposite to Tweeddale’s Close,
leading to the British Linen Company’s Bank. I left the vessel
late in the afternoon, and as the articles I had brought were
contraband, I put them under my jacket, and was proceeding
up Leith Walk, when I perceived a tall man carrying a yellow-coloured
parcel under his arm, and a genteel man, dressed in a
black coat, dogging him. I was a little afraid: I conceived the
man who carried the parcel to be a smuggler, and the gentleman
who followed him to be a custom-house or excise officer. In
dogging the man, the supposed officer went from one side of
the Walk to the other [the Walk is a broad street], as if afraid
of being noticed, but still kept about the same distance behind
him. I was afraid of losing what I carried, and shortened sail
a little, keeping my eyes fixed on the person I supposed to be
an officer, until I came to the head of Leith Street, when I saw
the smuggler take the North Bridge, and the custom-house officer
go in front of the Register Office; here he looked round him,
and imagining he was looking for me, I hove to, and watched
him. He then looked up the North Bridge, and, as I conceive,
followed the smuggler, for he went the same way. I stood a
minute or two where I was, and then went forward, walking
slowly up the North Bridge. I did not, however, see either of
the men before me; and when I came to the south end or head
of the Bridge, supposing that they might have gone up the High
Street or along the South Bridge, I turned to the left, and reached
the Netherbow, without again seeing either the smuggler or the
officer. Just, however, as I came opposite to Tweeddale’s Close,
<em>I saw the custom-house officer come running out of it with something
under his coat</em>: I think he ran down the street. Being much
alarmed, and supposing that the officer had also seen me and
knew what I carried, I deposited my little present in my mother’s
with all possible speed, and made the best of my way to Leith,
without hearing anything of the murder of Begbie until next day.
On coming on board the vessel, I told the mate what a narrow
escape I conceived I had made: he seemed somewhat alarmed
(having probably, like myself, smuggled some trifling article from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
Portugal), and told me in a peremptory tone that I should not go
ashore again without first acquainting him. I certainly heard of
the murder before I left Leith, and concluded that the man I saw
was the murderer; but the idea of waiting on a magistrate and
communicating what I had seen never struck me. We sailed in
a few days thereafter from Leith; and the vessel to which I
belonged having been captured by a privateer, I was carried to
a French prison, and only regained my liberty at the last peace.
I can now recollect distinctly the figure of the man I saw; he was
well dressed, had a genteel appearance, and wore a black coat.
I never saw his face properly, for he was before me the whole way
up the Walk; I think, however, he was a stout big man, but not
so tall as the man I then conceived to be a smuggler.’</p>

<p>This description of the supposed custom-house officer coincides
exactly with that of the appearance of Mackoull; and other circumstances
are given which almost make it certain that he was the
murderer. This Mackoull was a London rogue of unparalleled
effrontery and dexterity, who for years haunted Scotland, and effected
some daring robberies. He resided in Edinburgh from September
1805 till the close of 1806, and during that time frequented a
coffee-house in the <em>Ship Tavern</em> at Leith. He professed to be a
merchant expelled by the threats of the French from Hamburg,
and to live by a new mode of dyeing skins, but in reality he
practised the arts of a gambler and a pickpocket. He had a
mean lodging at the bottom of New Street in the Canongate, near
the scene of the murder of Begbie, to which it is remarkable
that <em>Leith Wynd</em> was the readiest as well as most private access
from that spot. No suspicion, however, fell upon Mackoull
at this period, and he left the country for a number of years, at
the end of which time he visited Glasgow, and there effected a
robbery of one of the banks. For this crime he did not escape
the law. He was brought to trial at Edinburgh in 1820, was
condemned to be executed, but died in jail while under reprieve
from his sentence.</p>

<p>The most striking part of the evidence which Mr Denovan
adduces against Mackoull is the report of a conversation which
he had with that person in the condemned cell of the Edinburgh
jail in July 1820, when Mackoull was very doubtful of being
reprieved. To pursue his own narrative, which is in the third
person: ‘He told Captain Sibbald [the superior of the prison]
that he intended to ask Mackoull a single question relative to
the murder of Begbie, but would first humour him by a few jokes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
so as to throw him off his guard, and prevent him from thinking
he had called for any particular purpose [it is to be observed that
Mr Denovan had a professional acquaintance with the condemned
man]; but desired Captain Sibbald to watch the features of the
prisoner when he (Denovan) put his hand to his chin, for he
would then put the question he meant. After talking some time
on different topics, Mr Denovan put this very simple question to
the prisoner: “By the way, Mackoull, if I am correct, you resided
at the foot of New Street, Canongate, in November 1806&mdash;did
you not?” He stared&mdash;he rolled his eyes, and, as if falling
into a convulsion, threw himself back upon his bed. In this condition
he continued for a few moments, when, as if recollecting
himself, he started up, exclaiming wildly: “No, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;! I
was then in the East Indies&mdash;in the West Indies. What do you
mean?” “I mean no harm, Mackoull,” he replied; “I merely
asked the question for my own curiosity; for I think when you
left these lodgings you went to Dublin. Is it not so?” “Yes,
yes, I went to Dublin,” he replied; “and I wish I had remained
there still. I won £10,000 there at the tables, and never knew
what it was to want cash, although you wished the folks here to
believe that they locked me up in Old Start (Newgate), and
brought down your friend Adkins to swear he saw me there: this
was more than your duty.” He now seemed to rave, and lose all
temper, and his visitor bade him good-night, and left him.’</p>

<p>It appears extremely probable, from the strong circumstantial
evidence which has been offered by Mr Denovan, that Mackoull
was the murderer of Begbie.</p>

<p>One remaining fact regarding the Netherbow will be listened to
with some interest. It was the home&mdash;perhaps the native spot&mdash;of
William Falconer, the author of <cite>The Shipwreck</cite>, whose father
was a wigmaker in this street.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

swarm of male cadets, who went abroad in quest of fortune, used
to produce a corresponding number of daughters, who stayed at
home, and for the most part became old maids. These gentlewomen,
after the death of their parents, when, of course, a brother
or nephew succeeded to the family seat and estate, were compelled
to leave home, and make room for the new laird to bring up a
new generation, destined in time to experience the same fate.
Many of these ladies, who in Catholic countries would have found
protection in nunneries, resorted to Edinburgh, where, with the
moderate family provision assigned them, they passed inoffensive
and sometimes useful lives, the peace of which was seldom broken
otherwise than by irruptions of their grand-nephews, who came
with the hunger of High School boys, or by the more stately calls
of their landed cousins and brothers, who rendered their visits the
more auspicious by a pound of hyson for the caddy, or a replenishment
of rappee for the snuff-box. The <em>leddies</em>, as they were
called, were at once the terror and the admiration of their neighbours
in the stair, who looked up to them as the patronesses of
the <em>land</em>, and as shedding a light of gentility over the flats below.</p>

<p>In the best days of the Old Town, people of all ranks lived very
closely and cordially together, and the whole world were in a
manner next-door neighbours. The population being dense, and
the town small, the distance between the houses of friends was
seldom considerable. When a hundred friends lived within the
space of so many yards, the company was easily collected, and
consequently meetings took place more frequently, and upon more
trivial occasions, than in these latter days of stately dinners and
fantastic balls. Tea&mdash;simple tea&mdash;was then almost the only meal
to which invitations were given. Tea-parties, assembling at four
o’clock, were resorted to by all who wished for elegant social
intercourse. There was much careful ceremonial in the dispensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
of those pretty, small china cups, individualised by the
numbers marked on each of the miniature spoons which circulated
with them, and of which four or five returns were not uncommon.
The spoon in the saucer indicated a wish for more&mdash;in the cup
the reverse. A few tunes on the spinnet, a Scotch song from
some young lady (solo), and the unfailing whist-table furnished
the entertainment. At eight o’clock to a minute would arrive the
sedan, or the lass with the lantern and pattens, and the whole
company would be at home before the eight o’clock drum of the
Town-guard had ceased to beat.</p>

<p>In a house at the head of the Canongate, but having its entrance
from St Mary’s Wynd, and several stairs up, lived two old maiden
ladies of the house of Traquair&mdash;the Ladies Barbara and Margaret
Stuart. They were twins, the children of Charles, the fourth earl,
and their birth on the 3rd of September, the anniversary of the
death of Cromwell, brought a Latin epigram from Dr Pitcairn&mdash;of
course previous to 1713, which was the year of his own death.
The learned doctor anticipated for them ‘timid wooers,’ but they
nevertheless came to old age unmarried. They drew out their
innocent, retired lives in this place, where, latterly, one of their
favourite amusements was to make dolls, and little beds for them
to lie on&mdash;a practice not quite uncommon in days long gone by,
being to some degree followed by Queen Mary.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>I may give, in the words of a long-deceased correspondent, an
anecdote of the ladies of Traquair, referring to the days when
potatoes had as yet an equivocal reputation, and illustrative of
the frugal scale by which our ‘leddies’ were in use to measure the
luxuries of their table. ‘Upon the return one day of their
weekly ambassador to the market, and the anxious investigation
by the old ladies of the contents of Jenny’s basket, the little
morsel of mutton, with a portion of accompanying off-falls, was
duly approved of. “But, Jenny, what’s this in the bottom of
the basket?” “Oo, mem, just a dozen o’ ’taties that Lucky,
the green-wife, wad ha’e me to tak’&mdash;they wad eat sae fine wi’ the
mutton.” “Na, na, Jenny; tak’ back the ’taties&mdash;we need nae
provocatives in this house.”’</p>

<p>The latest survivor of these Traquair ladies died in 1794.]</p>

<h3>BOTHWELL BRIDGE PRISONERS.</h3>

<p>As if there had been some destiny in the matter, the Greyfriars
Churchyard became connected with another remarkable event in
the religious troubles of the seventeenth century. At the south-west
angle, accessible by an old gateway bearing emblems of
mortality, and which is fitted with an iron-rail gate of very old
workmanship, is a kind of supplement to the burying-ground&mdash;an
oblong space, now having a line of sepulchral enclosures on each
side, but formerly empty. On these enclosures the visitor may
remark, as he passes, certain names venerable in the history of
science and of letters; as, for instance, Joseph Black and Alexander
Tytler. On one he sees the name of Gilbert Innes of Stow, who
left a million, to take six feet of earth here. These, however, do
not form the matter in point. Every lesser particular becomes
trivial beside the extraordinary use to which the place was put by
the Government in the year 1679. Several hundred of the prisoners
taken at Bothwell Bridge were confined here in the open air, under
circumstances of privation now scarcely credible. They had hardly
anything either to lie upon or to cover them; their allowance of
provision was four ounces of bread per day, with water derived
from one of the city pipes, which passed near the place. They
were guarded by day by eight and through the night by twenty-four
men; and the soldiers were told that if any prisoner escaped,
they should answer it life for life by cast of dice. If any prisoner
rose from the ground by night, he was shot at. Women alone
were permitted to commune with them, and bring them food or
clothes; but these had often to stand at the entrance from morning
till night without getting access, and were frequently insulted and
maltreated by the soldiers, without the prisoners being able to
protect them, although in many cases related by the most endearing
ties. In the course of several weeks a considerable number of the
prisoners had been liberated upon signing a bond, in which they
promised never again to take up arms against the king or without
his authority; but it appears that about four hundred, refusing
mercy on such terms, were kept in this frightful bivouac for five
months, being only allowed at the approach of winter to have
shingle huts erected over them, which was boasted of as a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
mercy. Finally, on the 15th of November, a remnant, numbering
two hundred and fifty-seven, were put on board a ship to be sent
to Barbadoes. The vessel was wrecked on one of the Orkney
Islands, when only about forty came ashore alive.</p>

<p>From the gloom of this sad history there is shed one ray of
romance. Amongst the charitable women of Edinburgh who came
to minister to the prisoners, there was one attended by a daughter&mdash;a
young and, at least by right of romance, a fair girl. Every
few days they approached this iron gate with food and clothes,
either from their own stores or collected among neighbours.
Between the young lady and one of the juvenile prisoners an
attachment sprang up. Doubtless she loved him for the dangers
he had passed in so good a cause, and he loved her because she
pitied them. In happier days, long after, when their constancy
had been well tried by an exile which he suffered in the plantations,
this pair were married, and settled in Edinburgh, where
they had sons and daughters. A respectable elderly citizen tells
me he is descended from them.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<h2><a name="STORY_OF_MRS_MACFARLANE" id="STORY_OF_MRS_MACFARLANE">STORY OF MRS MACFARLANE.</a></h2>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>‘Let them say I am romantic; so is every one said to be that either admires
a fine thing or does one. On my conscience, as the world goes, ’tis hardly worth
anybody’s while to do one for the honour of it. Glory, the only pay of generous
actions, is now as ill paid as other just debts; and neither Mrs Macfarlane for
immolating her lover, nor you for constancy to your lord, must ever hope to be
compared to Lucretia or Portia.’&mdash;<em>Pope to Lady Mary W. Montagu.</em></strong></p>


<p>Pope here alludes to a tragical incident which took place in
Edinburgh on the 2nd of October 1716. The victim was a
young Englishman, who had been sent down to Scotland as a
Commissioner of Customs. It appears that Squire Cayley, or
Captain Cayley, as he was alternatively called, had become the
slave of a shameful passion towards Mrs Macfarlane, a woman of
uncommon beauty, the wife of Mr John Macfarlane, Writer to the
Signet in Edinburgh. One Saturday forenoon Mrs Macfarlane
was exposed, by the treachery of Captain Cayley’s landlady, with
whom she was acquainted, to an insult of the most atrocious kind
on his part, in the house where he lodged, which seems to have
been situated in a close in the Cowgate, opposite to what were
called the Back Stairs.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Next Tuesday Mr Cayley waited upon
Mrs Macfarlane at her own house, and was shown into the drawing-room.
According to an account given out by his friends, he was
anxious to apologise for his former rudeness. From another
account, it would appear that he had circulated reports derogatory
to the lady’s honour, which she was resolved to punish. A third
story represents him as having repeated the insult which he had
formerly offered; whereupon she went into another room, and
presently came back with a pair of pistols in her hand. On her
bidding him leave the house instantly, he said: ‘What, madam,
d’ye design to act a comedy?’ To which she answered that ‘<em>he
would find it a tragedy if he did not retire</em>.’ The infatuated man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
not obeying her command, she fired one of the pistols, which,
however, only wounded him slightly in the left wrist, the bullet
slanting down into the floor. The mere instinct, probably, of self-preservation
caused him to draw his sword; but before he could
use it she fired the other pistol, the shot of which penetrated his
heart. ‘This dispute,’ says a letter of the day, ‘was so close that
Mr Cayley’s shirt was burnt at the sleeves with the fire of one of
the pistols, and his cravat and the breast of his shirt with the fire
of the other.’<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Mrs Macfarlane immediately left the room, locking
the door upon the dead body, and sent a servant for her husband,
who was found at a neighbouring tavern. On his coming home
about an hour after, she took him by the sleeve, and leading him
into the room where the corpse lay, explained the circumstances
which had led to the bloody act. Mr Macfarlane said: ‘Oh,
woman! what have you done?’ But soon seeing the necessity for
prompt measures, he went out again to consult with some of his
friends. ‘They all advised,’ says the letter just quoted, ‘that he
should convey his wife away privately, to prevent her lying in jail,
till a precognition should be taken of the affair, and it should
appear in its true light. Accordingly [about six o’clock], she
walked down the High Street, followed by her husband at a little
distance, and now absconds.</p>

<p>‘The thing continued a profound secret to all except those
concerned in the house till past ten at night, when Mr Macfarlane,
having provided a safe retreat for his wife, returned and gave
orders for discovering it to the magistrates, who went and viewed
the body of the deceased, and secured the house and maid, and all
else who may become evidence of the fact.’</p>

<p>Another contemporary says: ‘I saw his [Cayley’s] corpse after
he was cereclothed, and saw his blood where he lay on the floor for
twenty-four hours after he died, just as he fell; so it was a difficulty
to straight him.’</p>

<p>A careful investigation was made into every circumstance connected
with this fatal affair, but without demonstrating anything
except the passionate rashness or magnanimity of the fair homicide.
Mr Macfarlane was discharged upon his own affirmation that he
knew nothing of the deed till after it had taken place. A pamphlet
was published by Mrs Murray, Mr Cayley’s landlady, who seems
to have kept a grocery shop in the Cowgate, vindicating herself
from the imputation which Mrs Macfarlane’s tale had thrown upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
her character; but to this there appeared an answer, from some
friend of the other party, in which the imputation was fixed almost
beyond the possibility of doubt. Mrs Murray denied that Mrs
Macfarlane had been in her house on the Saturday before the
murder; but evidence was given that she was seen issuing from the
close in which Mrs Murray resided, and, after ascending the Back
Stairs, was observed passing through the Parliament Square towards
her own house.</p>

<p>It will surprise every one to learn that this Scottish Lucrece was
a woman of only nineteen or twenty years of age, and some months
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enceinte</i>, at the time when she so boldly vindicated her honour.
She was a person of respectable connections, being a daughter of
Colonel Charles Straiton, ‘a gentleman of great honour,’ says one
of the letters already quoted, and who further appears to have
been entrusted with high negotiations by the Jacobites during the
reign of Queen Anne. By her mother, she was granddaughter to
Sir Andrew Forrester.</p>

<p>Of the future history of Mrs Macfarlane we have but one glimpse,
but it is of a romantic nature. Margaret Swinton, who was the
aunt of Sir Walter Scott’s mother, and round whom he and his
boy-brothers used to close to listen to her tales, remembered being
one Sunday left by her parents at home in their house of Swinton
in Berwickshire, while the rest of the family attended church.
Tiring of the solitude of her little nursery, she stole quietly downstairs
to the parlour, which she entered somewhat abruptly. There,
to her surprise, she beheld the most beautiful woman she had ever
seen, sitting at the breakfast-table making tea. She believed it
could be no other than one of those enchanted queens whom she
had heard of in fairy tales. The lady, after a pause of surprise,
came up to her with a sweet smile, and conversed with her, concluding
with a request that she would speak only to her mamma
of the stranger whom she had seen. Presently after, little Margaret
having turned her back for a few moments, the beautiful vision had
vanished. The whole appeared like a dream. By-and-by the
family returned, and Margaret took her mother aside that she
might talk of this wonderful apparition. Mrs Swinton applauded
her for thus observing the injunction which had been laid upon
her. ‘Had you not,’ she added, ‘it might have cost that lady her
life.’ Subsequent explanations made Margaret aware that she had
seen the unfortunate Mrs Macfarlane, who, having some claim of
kindred upon the Swinton family, had been received by them, and
kept in a secret room till such time as she could venture to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
her way out of the country. On Margaret looking away for a
moment, the lady had glided by a sliding panel into her Patmos
behind the wainscot, and thus unwittingly increased the child’s
apprehension of the whole being an event out of the course of
nature.</p>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Distinguished Inhabitants in Former Times&mdash;Story of a Burning&mdash;Morocco’s
Land&mdash;New Street.</strong></p>


<p>The Canongate, which takes its name from the Augustine canons
of Holyrood (who were permitted to build it by the charter
of David I. in 1128, and afterwards ruled it as a burgh of regality),
was formerly the court end of the town. As the main avenue
from the palace into the city, it has borne upon its pavement the
burden of all that was beautiful, all that was gallant, all that has
become historically interesting in Scotland for the last six or seven
hundred years. It still presents an antique appearance, although
many of the houses are modernised. There is one with a date from
Queen Mary’s reign,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and many may be guessed, from their appearance,
to be of even an earlier era. Previously to the Union, when
the palace ceased to be occasionally inhabited, as it had formerly
been, by at least the vicar of majesty in the person of the Commissioner
to the Parliament, the place was densely inhabited by
persons of distinction. Allan Ramsay, in lamenting the death of
Lucky Wood, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse">‘Oh, Canigate, puir elrich hole,</div>
<div class="wideverse">What loss, what crosses does thou thole!</div>
<div class="wideverse">London and death gars thee look droll,</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">And hing thy head;</div>
<div class="wideverse">Wow but thou has e’en a cauld coal</div>
<div class="wideverse indent4">To blaw indeed;’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and mentions in a note that this place was ‘the greatest sufferer
by the loss of our members of parliament, which London now
enjoys, many of them having had their houses there;’ a fact which
Maitland confirms. Innumerable traces are to be found, in old
songs and ballads, of the elegant population of the Canongate in a
former day. In the piteous tale of Marie Hamilton&mdash;one of the
Queen’s Maries&mdash;occurs this simple but picturesque stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘As she cam’ doun the Cannogait,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Cannogait sae free,</div>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span></p>
<p>An old popular rhyme expresses the hauteur of these Canongate
dames towards their city neighbours of the male sex:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The lasses o’ the Canongate,</div>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Weir’s Close, Canongate&mdash;wretchedly squalid.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Even in times comparatively modern, this faubourg was inhabited
by persons of very great consideration.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Within the memory of
a lady living in 1830, it used to be a common thing to hear, among
other matters of gossip, ‘<em>that there was to be a braw flitting<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> in the
Canongate to-morrow</em>;’ and parties of young people were made up
to go and see the fine furniture brought out, sitting perhaps for
hours in the windows of some friend on the opposite side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
street, while cart after cart was laden with magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Many
of the houses to this day are fit for the residence of a first-rate
family in every respect
but <em>vicinage</em>
and <em>access</em>. The
last grand blow was
given to the place
by the opening of
the road along the
Calton Hill in
1817, which rendered
it no longer
the avenue of approach
to the city
from the east. Instead
of profiting by
the comparative retirement
which it
acquired on that
occasion, it seemed
to become the more
wretchedly squalid
from its being the
less under notice&mdash;as
a gentleman
dresses the least
carefully when not
expecting visitors.
It is now a secluded and, in general, meanly inhabited suburb,
only accessible by ways which, however lightly our fathers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
grandfathers might regard them, are hardly now pervious to a lady
or gentleman without shocking more of the senses than one, besides
the difficulty of steering one’s way through the herds of the idle
and the wretched who encumber the street.</p>

<p>One of the houses near the head of the Canongate, on the north
side of the street, was indicated to me by an old lady a few years
ago as that which tradition in her young days pointed to in connection
with a wild story related in the notes to <cite>Rokeby</cite>. She had
often heard the tale told, nearly in the same manner as it has been
given by Scott, and the site of the house concerned in the tragedy
was pointed out to her by her seniors. Perhaps the reader will
again excuse a quotation from the writings of our late gifted fellow-townsman:
if to be related at all&mdash;and surely in a work devoted
to Edinburgh popular legends it could not rightly be overlooked&mdash;it
may as well be given in the language of the prince of modern
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conteurs</i>:</p>

<p>‘About the beginning of the eighteenth century, when the large
castles of the Scottish nobles, and even the secluded hotels, like
those of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>, which they possessed in Edinburgh,
were sometimes the scenes of strange and mysterious transactions,
a divine of singular sanctity was called up at midnight to pray
with a person at the point of death. This was no unusual summons;
but what followed was alarming. He was put into a sedan-chair,
and after he had been transported to a remote part of the town,
the bearers insisted upon his being blindfolded. The request was
enforced by a cocked pistol, and submitted to; but in the course
of the discussion, he conjectured, from the phrases employed by the
chairmen, and from some part of their dress, not completely concealed
by their cloaks, that they were greatly above the menial
station they assumed. After many turns and windings, the chair
was carried upstairs into a lodging, where his eyes were uncovered,
and he was introduced into a bedroom, where he found a lady,
newly delivered of an infant. He was commanded by his attendants
to say such prayers by her bedside as were fitting for a person
not expected to survive a mortal disorder. He ventured to remonstrate,
and observe that her safe delivery warranted better hopes.
But he was sternly commanded to obey the orders first given, and
with difficulty recollected himself sufficiently to acquit himself of
the task imposed on him. He was then again hurried into the
chair; but as they conducted him downstairs he heard the report
of a pistol. He was safely conducted home; a purse of gold was
forced upon him; but he was warned, at the same time, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
least allusion to this dark transaction would cost him his life. He
betook himself to rest, and after long and broken musing, fell into
a deep sleep. From this he was awakened by his servant, with the
dismal news that a fire of uncommon fury had broken out in the
house of &mdash;&mdash;, near the head of the Canongate, and that it was
totally consumed; with the shocking addition that the daughter
of the proprietor, a young lady eminent for beauty and accomplishments,
had perished in the flames. The clergyman had his
suspicions, but to have made them public would have availed
nothing. He was timid; the family was of the first distinction;
above all, the deed was done, and could not be amended. Time
wore away, however, and with it his terrors. He became unhappy
at being the solitary depositary of this fearful mystery, and mentioned
it to some of his brethren, through whom the anecdote
acquired a sort of publicity. The divine, however, had been long
dead, and the story in some degree forgotten, when a fire broke out
again on the very same spot where the house of &mdash;&mdash; had formerly
stood, and which was now occupied by buildings of an inferior
description. When the flames were at their height, the tumult
which usually attends such a scene was suddenly suspended by
an unexpected apparition. A beautiful female, in a nightdress
extremely rich, but at least half a century old, appeared in the
very midst of the fire, and uttered these tremendous words in her
vernacular idiom: “<em>Anes</em> burned, <em>twice</em> burned; the <em>third</em> time I’ll
scare you all!” The belief in this story was formerly so strong
that on a fire breaking out, and seeming to approach the fatal
spot, there was a good deal of anxiety testified, lest the apparition
should make good her denunciation.’</p>

<p>A little way farther down the Canongate, on the same side, is
an old-fashioned house called <em>Morocco’s Land</em>, having an alley
passing under it, over which is this inscription<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;a strange cry of
the spirit of man to be heard in a street:</p>

<p class="center">
MISERERE MEI, DOMINE: A PECCATO, PROBRO,<br />
DEBITO, ET MORTE SUBITA, LIBERA ME.
</p>

<p>From whom this exclamation proceeded I have never learned; but
the house, which is of more modern date than the legend, has a
story connected with it. It is said that a young woman belonging
to Edinburgh, having been taken upon a voyage by an African
rover, was sold to the harem of the Emperor of Morocco, with
whom she became a favourite. Mindful, like her countrymen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
general, of her native land and her relations, she held such a
correspondence with home as led to a brother of hers entering into
merchandise, and conducting commercial transactions
with Morocco. He was successful, and realised a
little fortune, out of which he built this stately
mansion. From gratitude, or out of a feeling
of vanity regarding his imperial brother-in-law,
he erected a statue of that personage
in front of his house&mdash;a black,
naked figure, with a turban and a
necklace of beads; such being the
notion which a Scottish artist
of those days entertained
of the personal
aspect of the chief of
one of the Mohammedan
states of
Africa. And this
figure, perched in a
little stone pulpit,
still exists. As to
the name bestowed
upon the house, it
would most probably
arise from the man
being in the first place called
<em>Morocco</em> by way of sobriquet,
as is common when any one
becomes possessed by a particular
subject, and often
speaks of it.</p>

<p>A little farther along is
the opening of New Street,
a modern offshoot of the
ancient city, dating from a
time immediately before the
rise of the New Town. Many
persons of consequence lived
here: Lord Kames, in a neat house at the top, on the east side&mdash;an
edifice once thought so fine that people used to bring their
country cousins to see it; Lord Hailes, in a house more than half-way
down, afterwards occupied by Mr Ruthven, mechanist; Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
Philip Ainslie, in another house in the same row. The passers-by
were often arrested by the sight of Sir Philip’s preparations for a
dinner-party through the open windows, the show of plate being
particularly great. Now all these mansions are left to become
workshops. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic transit.</i><a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Opposite to Kames’s house is a small

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Lord Monboddo’s Suppers&mdash;The Sister of Smollett&mdash;Anecdote
of Henry Dundas.</strong></p>


<p>St John Street, so named with reference to St John’s Cross
above mentioned, was one of the heralds of the New Town. In
the latter half of the last century it was occupied solely by persons
of distinction&mdash;nobles, judges, and country gentleman; now it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
possessed as exclusively by persons of the middle rank. In No. 13
lived that eccentric genius, Lord Monboddo, whose supper-parties,
conducted in classic taste, frequented by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i>, and for a
time presided over by an angel in the form of a daughter of his
lordship, were of immense attraction in their day. In a stair at
the head of this street lived the sister of the author of <cite>Roderick
Random</cite>.</p>

<p>Smollett’s life as a literary adventurer in London, and the full
participation he had in the woes of authors by profession, have
perhaps conveyed an erroneous idea of his birth and connections.
The Smolletts of Dumbartonshire were in reality what was called
in Scotland a good old family. The novelist’s own grandfather
had been one of the commissioners for the Union between England
and Scotland. And it is an undoubted fact that Tobias himself,
if he had lived two or three years longer, would have become the
owner of the family estate, worth about a thousand a year. All
this, to any one conversant with the condition of the Scottish
gentry in the early part of the last century, will appear quite
consistent with his having been brought up as a druggist’s
apprentice in Glasgow&mdash;‘the bubbly-nosed callant, wi’ the stane
in his pouch,’ as his master affectionately described him, with
reference to his notorious qualities as a Pickle.</p>

<p>The sister of Smollett&mdash;she who, failing him, did succeed to the
family property&mdash;was a Mrs Telfer, domiciled as a gentle widow
in a common stair at the head of St John Street (west side), first
door up. She is described as a somewhat stern-looking specimen
of her sex, with a high cast of features, but in reality a good-enough-natured
woman, and extremely shrewd and intelligent.
One passion of her genus possessed her&mdash;whist. A relative tells
me that one of the city magistrates, who was a tallow-chandler,
calling upon her one evening, she said: ‘Come awa, bailie, and
take a trick at the cartes.’</p>

<p>‘Troth, ma’am,’ said he, ‘I hav’na a bawbee in my pouch.’</p>

<p>‘Tut, man, ne’er mind that,’ replied the lady; ‘let’s e’en play
for a pund o’ candles!’</p>

<p>During his last visit to Edinburgh (1766)&mdash;the visit which
occasioned <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>&mdash;Smollett lived in his sister’s house.
A person who recollects seeing him there describes him as dressed
in black clothes, tall, and extremely handsome, but quite unlike
the portraits at the front of his works, all of which are disclaimed
by his relations. The unfortunate truth appears to be that the
world is in possession of no genuine likeness of Smollett! He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
very peevish, on account of the ill-health to which he had been so
long a martyr, and used to complain much of a severe ulcerous
disorder in his arm.</p>

<p>His wife, according to the same authority, was a Creole, with a
dark complexion, though, upon the whole, rather pretty&mdash;a fine
lady, but a silly woman. Yet she had been the Narcissa of
<cite>Roderick Random</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>In <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>, Smollett works up many observations of
things and persons which he had made in his recent visit to
Scotland. His relative Commissary Smollett, and the family seat
near Loch Lomond, receive ample notice. The story in the family
is that while Matthew Bramble was undoubtedly himself, he
meant in the gay and sprightly Jerry Melford to describe his
sister’s son, Major Telfer, and in Liddy to depict his own daughter,
who was destined to be the wife of the major, but, to the inexpressible
and ineffaceable grief of her father, died before the
scheme could be accomplished. Jerry, it will be recollected, ‘got
some damage from the bright eyes of the charming Miss R&mdash;&mdash;n,
whom he had the honour to dance with at the ball.’ Liddy
contracted an intimate friendship with the same person. This
young beauty was Eleonora Renton, charming by the true right
divine, for she was daughter of Mr Renton of Lamerton, by Lady
Susan Montgomery, one of the fair offshoots of the house of
Eglintoune, described in a preceding article. A sister of hers
was married to Smollett’s eldest nephew, Telfer, who became
inheritor of the family estate, and on account of it took the
surname of Smollett: a large modern village in Dumbartonshire
takes its name from this lady. It seems to have been this
connection which brought the charming Eleonora under the
novelist’s attention. She afterwards married Charles Sharpe of
Hoddam, and became the mother of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe,
the well-known antiquary. Strange to say, the lady whose bright
eyes had flamed upon poor Smollett’s soul in the middle of the
last century, was living so lately as 1836.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_305">Page 305.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>When Smollett was confined in the King’s Bench Prison for the
libel upon Admiral Knowles, he formed an intimacy with the
celebrated Tenducci. This melodious singing-bird had recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
got his wings clipped by his creditors, and was mewed up in the
same cage with the novelist. Smollett’s friendship proceeded to
such a height that he paid the vocalist’s debts from his own purse,
and procured him his liberty. Tenducci afterwards visited
Scotland, and was one night singing in a private circle, when
somebody told him that a lady present was a near relation of his
benefactor; upon which the grateful Italian prostrated himself
before her, kissed her hands, and acted so many fantastic extravagances,
after the foreign fashion, that she was put extremely out
of countenance.</p>

<p>On the west side of the street, immediately to the south of the
Canongate Kilwinning Mason Lodge, there is a neat self-contained
house of old fashion, with a flower-plot in front. This was the
residence of &mdash;&mdash; Anderson, merchant in Leith, the father of seven
sons, all of whom attained respectable situations in life: one was
the late Mr Samuel Anderson of St Germains, banker. They had
been at school with Mr Henry Dundas (afterwards Lord Melville);
and when he had risen to high office, he called one day on Mr
Anderson, and expressed his earnest wish to have the pleasure of
dining with his seven school companions, all of whom happened at
that time to be at home. The meeting took place at Mr Dundas’s,
and it was a happy one, particularly to the host, who, when the
hour of parting arrived, filled a bumper in high elation to their
healths, and mentioned that they were the only men who had ever
dined with him since he became a public servant who had not
asked some favour either for themselves or their friends.</p>

<p>The house adjoining to the one last mentioned&mdash;having its
gable to the street, and a garden to the south&mdash;was, about 1780,
the residence of the Earl of Wemyss. A Lady Betty Charteris,
of this family, occupied the one farthest to the south on that side
of the street. She was a person of romantic history, for, being
thwarted in an affair of the heart, she lay in bed for twenty-six
years, till dismissed to the world where such troubles are unknown.</p>

<h2><a name="MORAY_HOUSE" id="MORAY_HOUSE">MORAY HOUSE.</a></h2>


<p>In the Canongate there is a house which has had the fortune to
be connected with more than one of the most interesting points
in our history. It is usually styled Moray House, being the
entailed property of the noble family of Moray. The large
proportions and elegant appearance of this mansion distinguish it
from all the surrounding buildings, and in the rear (1847) there is
a fine garden, descending in the old fashion by a series of terraces.
Though long deserted by the Earls of Moray, it has been till a
recent time kept in the best order, being occupied by families of
respectable character.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>This house was built in the early part of the reign of Charles
I. (about 1628) by Mary, Countess of Home, then a widow. Her
ladyship’s initials, M. H., appear, in cipher fashion, underneath
her coronet upon various parts of the exterior; and over one of
the principal windows towards the street there is a lozenge shield,
containing the two lions rampant which form the coat armorial of
the Home family. Lady Home was an English lady, being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
daughter of Edward Sutton, Lord Dudley. She seems to have
been unusually wealthy for the dowager of a Scottish earl, for in
1644 the English Parliament repaid seventy thousand pounds
which she had lent to the Scottish Covenanting Government; and
she is found in the same year lending seven thousand to aid in
paying the detachment of troops which that Government had sent
to Ireland. She was also a sufferer, however, by the civil war, in
as far as Dunglass House, which was blown up in 1640, by
accident, when in the hands of the Covenanters, belonged to her
in liferent. To her affluent circumstances, and the taste which
she probably brought with her from her native country, may be
ascribed the superior style of this mansion, which not only displays
in the outside many traces of the elegant architecture which
prevailed in England in the reign of James I., but contains two
state apartments, decorated in the most elaborate manner, both
in the walls and ceilings, with the favourite stucco-work of that
reign. On the death of Lady Home the house passed (her ladyship
having no surviving male issue) to her daughters and co-heiresses,
Margaret, Countess of Moray, and Anne, Countess (afterwards
Duchess) of Lauderdale, between whom the entire property of their
father, the first Earl of Home, appears to have been divided, his
title going into another line. By an arrangement between the
two sisters, the house became, in 1645, the property of the
Countess of Moray and her son James, Lord Doune.</p>

<p>It stood in this condition as to ownership, though still popularly
called ‘Lady Home’s Lodging,’ when, in the summer of 1648,
Oliver Cromwell paid his first visit to Edinburgh. Cromwell had
then just completed the overthrow of the army of the <em>Engagement</em>&mdash;a
gallant body of troops which had been sent into England by
the more Cavalier party of the Scottish Covenanters, in the hope
of rescuing the king from the hands of the sectaries. The
victorious general, with his companion Lambert, took up his
quarters in this house, and here received the visits of some of the
leaders of the less loyal party of the Covenanters&mdash;the Marquis of
Argyll, the Chancellor Loudoun, the Earl of Lothian, the Lords
Arbuthnot, Elcho, and Burleigh, and the Reverend Messrs David
Dickson, Robert Blair, and James Guthrie. ‘What passed among
them,’ says Bishop Henry Guthrie in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, ‘came not to
be known infallibly; but it was talked very loud that he did
communicate to them his design in reference to the king, and had
their assent thereto.’ It is scarcely necessary to remark that this
was probably no more than a piece of Cavalier scandal, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
is no reason to believe that Cromwell, if he yet contemplated the
death of the king, would have disclosed his views to men still so
far tinctured with loyalty as those enumerated. Cromwell’s object
in visiting Edinburgh on this occasion and in holding these
conferences, was probably limited to the reinstatement of the ultra-Presbyterian
party in the government, from which the Duke of
Hamilton and other loyalists had lately displaced it.</p>

<p>When, in 1650, the Lord Lorn, eldest son of the Marquis of
Argyll, was married to Lady Mary Stuart, eldest daughter of the
Earl of Moray, the wedding feast ‘stood,’ as contemporary writers
express it, at the Earl of Moray’s house in the Canongate. The
event so auspicious to these great families was signalised by a
circumstance of a very remarkable kind. A whole week had been
passed in festivity by the wedded pair and their relations, when,
on Saturday the 18th of May, the Marquis of Montrose was
brought to Edinburgh, an excommunicated and already condemned
captive, having been taken in the north in an unsuccessful attempt
to raise a Cavalier party for his young and exiled prince. When
the former relative circumstances of Argyll and Montrose are
called to mind&mdash;when it is recollected that they had some years
before struggled for an ascendancy in the civil affairs of Scotland,
that Montrose had afterwards chased Argyll round and round the
Highlands, burned and plundered his country undisturbed, and on
one occasion overthrown his forces in a sanguinary action, while
Argyll looked on from a safe distance at sea&mdash;the present relative
circumstances of the two chiefs become a striking illustration of
the vicissitudes in personal fortune that characterise a time of civil
commotion. Montrose, after riding from Leith on a sorry horse,
was led into the Canongate by the Watergate, and there placed
upon a low cart, driven by the common executioner. In this
ignominious fashion he was conducted up the street towards the
prison, in which he was to have only two days to live, and in
passing along was necessarily brought under the walls and windows
of Moray House. On his approach to that mansion, the Marquis
of Argyll, his lady, and children, together with the whole of the
marriage-party, left their banqueting, and stepping out to a
balcony which overhangs the street, there planted themselves to
gaze on the prostrated enemy of their house and cause. Here,
indeed, they had the pleasure of seeing Montrose in all external
circumstances reduced beneath their feet; but they had not
calculated on the strength of nature which enabled that extraordinary
man to overcome so much of the bitterness of humiliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
and of death. He is said to have gazed upon them with so much
serenity that they shrank back with some degree of discomposure,
though not till the marchioness had expressed her spite at the
fallen hero by spitting at him&mdash;an act which in the present age
will scarcely be credible, though any one well acquainted with the
history of the seventeenth century will have too little reason to
doubt it.</p>

<p>In a Latin manuscript of this period, the gardens connected
with the house of the Earl of Moray are spoken of as ‘of such
elegance, and cultivated with so much care, as to vie with those
of warmer countries, and perhaps even of England itself. And
here,’ pursues the writer, ‘you may see how much the art and
industry of man may avail in supplying the defects of nature.
Scarcely any one would believe it possible to give so much beauty
to a garden in this frigid clime.’ One reason for the excellence of
the garden may have been its southern exposure. On the uppermost
of its terraces there is a large and beautiful thorn, with pensile
leaves; on the second there are some fruit-trees, the branches of
which have been caused to spread out in a particular way, so as to
form a kind of cup, possibly for the reception of a pleasure-party,
for such fantastic twistings of nature were not uncommon among
our ancestors. In the lowest level of the garden there is a little
receptacle for water, beside which is the statue of a fishing-boy,
having a basket of fish at his feet, and a <em>clam-shell</em> inverted upon
his head.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Here is also a small building, surmounted by two lions
holding female shields, and which may therefore be supposed
contemporaneous with the house: this was formerly a summer-house,
but has latterly been expanded into the character of a
conservatory. Tradition vaguely reports it as the place where the
Union between England and Scotland was signed; though there is
also a popular story of that fact having been accomplished in a
<em>laigh shop</em> of the High Street (marked No. 117), at one time a
tavern, and known as the <em>Union Cellar</em>.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Probably the rumour,
in at least the first instance, refers only to private arrangements
connected with the passing of the celebrated statute in question.
The Chancellor Earl of Seafield inhabited Moray House at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
time on lease, and nothing could be more likely than that he
should there have after-dinner consultations on the pending
measure, which might in the evening be adjourned to this garden
retreat.</p>

<p>It would appear that about this period the garden attached
to the house was a sort of a public promenade or lounging-place;
as was also the garden connected with Heriot’s Hospital. In
this character it forms a scene in the licentious play called <cite>The
Assembly</cite>, written in 1692 by Dr Pitcairn. <em>Will</em>, ‘a discreet
smart gentleman,’ as he is termed in the prefixed list of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i>, but in reality a perfect debauchee, first makes an
appointment with Violetta, his mistress, to meet her in this place;
and as she is under the charge of a sourly devout aunt, he has
to propound the matter in metaphorical language. Pretending
to expound a particular passage in the Song of Solomon for
the benefit of the dame, he thus gives the hint to her young
protégée:</p>

<p>‘<em>Will.</em> “Come, my beloved, let us walk in the fields, let us
lodge in the villages.” The same metaphor still. The kirk
not having the liberty of bringing her servant to her mother’s
house, resolveth to meet him in the villages, such as the Canongate,
in respect of Edinburgh; and the vineyard, such as <em>my
Lady Murray’s Yards</em>, to use a homely comparison.</p>

<p>‘<em>Old Lady.</em> A wondrous young man this!</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>‘<em>Will.</em> The eighth chapter towards the close: “Thou that
dwellest in the gardens, cause me to hear thy voice.”</p>

<p>‘<em>Violetta.</em> That’s still alluding to the metaphor of a gallant,
who, by some signs, warns his mistress to make haste&mdash;a whistle
or so. The same with early in the former chapter; that is to
say, to-morrow by six o’clock. Make haste to accomplish our
loves.</p>

<p>‘<em>Old L.</em> Thou art a hopeful girl; I hope God has blest my
pains on thee.’</p>

<p>In terms of this curious assignation, the third act opens in a
walk in Lady Murray’s Yards, where Will meets his beloved
Violetta. After a great deal of badinage, in the style of Dryden’s
comedies, which were probably Dr Pitcairn’s favourite models, the
dialogue proceeds in the following style:</p>

<p>‘<em>Will.</em> I’ll marry you at the rights, if you can find in your
heart to give yourself to an honest fellow of no great fortune.</p>

<p>‘<em>Vio.</em> In truth, sir, methinks it were fully as much for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
future comfort to bestow myself, and any little fortune I have,
upon you, as some reverend spark in a band and short cloak,
with the patrimony of a good gift of prayer, and as little sense
as his father, who was hanged in the Grassmarket for murdering
the king’s officers, had of honesty.</p>

<p>‘<em>Will.</em> Then I must acknowledge, my dear madam, I am most
damnably in love with you, and must have you by foul or fair
means; choose you whether.</p>

<p>‘<em>Vio.</em> I’ll give you fair-play in an honest way.</p>

<p>‘<em>Will.</em> Then, madam, I can command a parson when I please;
and if you be half so kind as I could wish, we’ll take a hackney,
and trot up to some honest curate’s house: besides, a guinea or
so will be a charity to him perhaps.</p>

<p>‘<em>Vio.</em> Hold a little; I am hardly ready for that yet,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the departure of this hopeful couple, Lord Huffy and
Lord Whigriddin, who are understood to have been intended for
Lord Leven (son of the Earl of Melville) and the Earl of Crawford,
enter the gardens, and hold some discourse of a different kind.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SPEAKING_HOUSE" id="THE_SPEAKING_HOUSE">THE SPEAKING HOUSE.</a></h2>


<p>The mansion on which I venture to confer this title is an old
one of imposing appearance, a little below Moray House.
It is conspicuous by three gables presented to the street, and by
the unusual space of linear ground which it occupies. Originally,
it has had no door to the street. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> gives admittance
to a close behind, from which every part of the house had been
admissible, and when this gateway was closed the inhabitants
would be in a tolerably defensible position. In this feature the
house gives a striking idea of the insecurity which marked the
domestic life of three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>It was built in the year of the assassination of the Regent Moray,
and one is somewhat surprised to think that, at so dark a crisis
of our national history, a mansion of so costly a character should
have taken its rise. The owner, whatever grade he held, seems to
have felt an apprehension of the popular talk on the subject of
his raising so elegant a mansion; and he took a curious mode
of deprecating its expression. On a tablet over the ground-floor
he inscribes: <span class="smcap lowercase">HODIE MIHI: CRAS TIBI. CUR IGITUR CURAS?</span> along
with the year of the erection, 1570. This is as much as to say:
‘I am the happy man to-day; your turn may come to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
Why, then, should you repine?’ One can imagine from a
second tablet, a little way farther along the front, that as
the building proceeded, the storm of public remark and outcry
had come to be more and more bitter, so that the soul of the
owner got stirred up into a firm and defying anger. He exclaims
(for, though a lettered inscription, one feels it as an exclamation):
<span class="smcap">Ut Tu Linguæ tuæ, sic Ego Mear. aurium, Dominus sum</span> (‘As
thou of thy tongue, so I of my ears, am lord’); thus quoting,
in his rage on this petty occasion, an expression said to have been
used in the Roman senate by Titus Tacitus when repelling the
charges of Lucius Metellus.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Afterwards he seems to have cooled
into a religious view of the predicament, and in a third legend
along the front he tells the world: <span class="smcap">Constanti pectori res
mortalium umbra</span>; ending a little farther on with an emblem of
the Christian hope of the Resurrection, ears of wheat springing
from a handful of bones. It is a great pity that we should not
know who was the builder and owner of this house, since he has
amused us so much with the history of his feelings during the
process of its erection. A friend at my elbow suggests&mdash;a
schoolmaster! But who ever heard of a schoolmaster so handsomely
remunerated by his profession as to be able to build a
house?</p>

<p>Nothing else is known of the early history of this house beyond
the fact of the Canongate magistrates granting a charter for it
to the Hammermen of that burgh, September 10, 1647.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> It was,
however, in 1753 occupied by a person of no less distinction than
the Dowager Duchess of Gordon.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>In the alley passing under this mansion there is a goodly
building of more modern structure, forming two sides of a quadrangle,
with a small court in front divided from the lane by a
wall in which there is a large gateway. Amidst filthiness indescribable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
one discerns traces of former elegance: a crest over the
doorway&mdash;namely, a cock mounted on a trumpet, with the motto
‘<span class="smcap">Vigilantibus</span>,’ and the date 1633; over two upper windows,
the letters ‘S. A. A.’ and ‘D. M. H.’ These memorials, with
certain references in the charter before mentioned, leave no
room for doubt that this was the house of Sir Archibald
Acheson of Abercairny,
Secretary
of State for Scotland
in the reign
of Charles I., and
ancestor to the
Earl of Gosford
in Ireland, who
to this day bears
the same crest
and motto. The
letters are the
initials of Sir Archibald
and his wife, Dame
Margaret Hamilton.
Here of course was the
<em>court</em> of Scotland for
a certain time, the Secretary
of State being the
grand dispenser of patronage
in our country
at that period&mdash;<em>here</em>,
where nothing but the
extremest wretchedness
is now to be seen! That boastful bird, too, still seeming to
assert the family dignity, two hundred years after it ceased to
have any connection with the spot! Verily there are some moral
preachments in these dark old closes if modern refinement could
go to hear the sermon!</p>

<p>Sir Archibald Acheson acquired extensive lands in Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
which have ever since been in the possession of his family. It
was a descendant of his, and of the same name, who had the
gratification of becoming the landlord of Swift at Market-hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
and whom the dean was consequently led to celebrate in many
of his poems. Swift seems to have been
on the most familiar terms with this
worthy knight and his lady; the latter
he was accustomed to call <em>Skinnibonia</em>,
<em>Lean</em>, or <em>Snipe</em>, as the humour inclined
him. The inimitable comic painting of
her ladyship’s maid Hannah, in the
debate whether Hamilton’s Bawn should
be turned into a malt-house or a barrack,
can never perish from our literature.
In like humour, the dean asserts the
superiority of himself and his brother-tenant
Colonel Leslie, who had served
much in Spain, over the knight:</p>

<p>Twenty years before the Duchess of Gordon lived in the venerable
house at the head of the close, a preceding dowager resided
in another part of the town. This was the distinguished Lady
Elizabeth Howard (daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, by Lady
Anne Somerset, daughter of the Marquis of Worcester), who
occasioned so much disturbance in the end of Queen Anne’s reign
by the Jacobite medal which she sent to the Faculty of Advocates.
Her grace lived in a house at the Abbeyhill, where, as we are
informed by Wodrow, in a tone of pious horror,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> she openly kept
a kind of college for instructing young people in Jesuitism and
Jacobitism together. In this labour she seems to have been
assisted by the Duchess of Perth, a kindred soul, whose enthusiasm
afterwards caused the ruin of her family, by sending her son into
the insurrection of 1745.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The Duchess of Gordon died here in
1732. I should suppose the house to have been that respectable
old villa, at the extremity of the suburb of Abbeyhill, in which
the late Baron Norton, of the Court of Exchequer, lived for many
years. It was formerly possessed by Baron Mure, who, during the
administration of the Earl of Bute, exercised the duties and dispensed
the patronage of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-ministre</i> for Scotland, under the
Hon. Stuart Mackenzie, younger brother of the Premier. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
was of course in its turn the <em>court</em> of Scotland; and from the
description of a gentleman old enough to remember attending the
levees (Sir W. M. Bannatyne), I should suppose that it was as
much haunted by suitors of all kinds as ever were the more elegant
halls of Holyrood House. Baron Mure, who was the personal
friend of Earl Bute, died in 1774.</p>

<h2><a name="PANMURE_HOUSE_ADAM_SMITH" id="PANMURE_HOUSE_ADAM_SMITH">PANMURE HOUSE&mdash;ADAM SMITH.</a></h2>


<p>At the bottom of a close a little way below the Canongate
Church, there is a house which a few years ago bore the
appearance of one of those small semi-quadrangular manor-houses
which were prevalent in the country about the middle of the
seventeenth century.
It is now
altered, and
brought into juxtaposition
with
the coarse details
of an ironfoundry,
yet still is not
without some
traits of its
original style. The
name of Panmure
House takes the
mind back to the
Earls of Panmure,
the fourth of
whom lost title
and estates for his
concern in the
affair of 1715;
but I am not certain
of any earlier
proprietor of this
family than
William Maule,
nephew of the
attainted earl,
created Earl of Panmure as an Irish title in 1743. <em>He</em> possessed
the house in the middle of the last century.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/illus_p_318.jpg" width="350" height="406" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Back of Canongate Tolbooth&mdash;Tolbooth Wynd.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All reference to rank in connection with this house appears
trivial in comparison with the fact that it was the residence of
Adam Smith from 1778, when he came to live in Edinburgh as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
a commissioner of the customs, till his death in 1790, when he
was interred in a somewhat obscure situation at the back of the
Canongate Tolbooth. In his time the house must have seen
the most intellectual company to be had in Scotland; but it had
not the honour of being the birthplace of any of Smith’s great
works. His last and greatest&mdash;the book which has undoubtedly
done more for the good of the community than any other ever
produced in Scotland&mdash;was the work of ten quiet, studious years
previous to 1778, during which the philosopher lived in his
mother’s house in Kirkcaldy.</p>

<p>The gentle, virtuous character of Smith has left little for the
anecdotist. The utmost simplicity marked the externals of the
man. He said very truly (being in possession of a handsome
library) that ‘he was only a beau in his books.’ Leading an
abstracted, scholarly life, he was ill-fitted for common worldly
affairs. Some one remarked to a friend of mine while Smith still
lived: ‘How strange to think of one who has written so well on
the principles of exchange and barter&mdash;he is obliged to get a
friend to buy his horse-corn for him!’ The author of the <cite>Wealth
of Nations</cite> never thought of marrying. His household affairs
were managed to his perfect contentment by a female cousin, a
Miss Jeanie Douglas, who almost necessarily acquired a great
control over him. It is said that the amiable philosopher, being
fond of a bit sugar, and chid by her for taking it, would sometimes,
in sauntering backwards and forwards along the parlour, watch
till Miss Jeanie’s back was turned in order to supply himself with
his favourite morsel. Such things are not derogatory to greatness
like Smith’s: they link it to human nature, and secure for it the
love, as it had previously possessed the admiration, of common
men.</p>

<p>The one personal circumstance regarding Smith which has made
the greatest impression on his fellow-citizens is the rather too
well-known anecdote of the two fishwomen. He was walking
along the streets one day, deeply abstracted, and speaking in a
low tone to himself, when he caught the attention of two of these
many-petticoated ladies, engaged in selling their fish. They
exchanged significant looks, bearing strong reference to the
restraints of a well-managed lunatic asylum, and then sighed one
to the other: ‘Aih, sirs; and he’s weel put on too!’&mdash;that is,
well dressed; his gentleman-like condition making the case appear
so much the more piteous.</p>

<p>In the Canongate, nearly opposite to Queensberry House, is a
narrow, old-fashioned mansion, of peculiar form, having a coat-armorial
conspicuously placed at the top, and a plain slab over
the doorway containing the following inscriptions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘I hate no person.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It appears that this quatrain was the production of Dr
Pitcairn, while the
sentence below is an
anagram upon the
name of <span class="smcap">John
Patersone</span>. The
stanza expresses that
‘when Paterson had
been crowned victor
in a game peculiar
to Scotland, in which
his ancestors had
also been often victorious,
he then
built this mansion,
which one conquest
raised him
above all his predecessors.’

resort to tradition

of this obscure
hint.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Golfers’ Land.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Till a recent
period, golfing had
long been conducted
upon the Links of Leith.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It had even been the sport of princes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
that field. We are told by Mr William Tytler of Woodhouselee
that Charles I. and the Duke of York (afterwards James II.)
played at golf on Leith Links, in succession, during the brief
periods of their residence in Holyrood. Though there is an
improbability in this tale as far as Charles is concerned, seeing
that he spent too short a time in Edinburgh to have been able
to play at a game notorious for the time necessary in acquiring
it, I may quote the anecdote related by Mr Tytler: ‘That while
he was engaged in a party at golf on the green or Links of
Leith, a letter was delivered into his hands, which gave him the
first account of the insurrection and rebellion in Ireland; on
reading which, he suddenly called for his coach, and leaning on
one of his attendants, and in great agitation, drove to the palace
of Holyrood House, from whence next day he set out for London.’
Mr Tytler says, regarding the Duke of York, that he ‘was
frequently seen in a party at golf on the Links of Leith with
some of the nobility and gentry. I remember in my youth to
have often conversed with an old man named Andrew Dickson,
a golf-club maker, who said that, when a boy, he used to carry
the duke’s golf-clubs, and run before him, and announce where
the balls fell.’<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tradition reports that when the duke lived in Holyrood House
he had on one occasion a discussion with two English noblemen
as to the native country of golf; his Royal Highness asserting
that it was peculiar to Scotland, while they as pertinaciously
insisted that it was an English game as well. Assuredly, whatever
may have been the case in those days, it is not now an
English game in the proper sense of the words, seeing that it is
only played to the south of the Tweed by a few fraternities of
Scotsmen, who have acquired it in their own country in youth.
However this may be, the two English nobles proposed, good-humouredly,
to prove its English character by taking up the
duke in a match to be played on Leith Links. James, glad of
an opportunity to make popularity in Scotland, in however small
a way, accepted the challenge, and sought for the best partner
he could find. By an association not at this day surprising to
those who practise the game, the heir-presumptive of the British
throne played in concert with a poor shoemaker named John
Paterson, the worthy descendant of a long line of illustrious
golfers. If the two southrons were, as might be expected,
inexperienced in the game, they had no chance against a pair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
one member of which was a good player. So the duke got the
best of the practical argument; and Paterson’s merits were
rewarded by a gift of the sum played for. The story goes on to
say that John was thus enabled to build a somewhat stylish
house for himself in the Canongate, on the top of which, being
a Scotsman, and having of course a pedigree, he clapped the
Paterson arms&mdash;three pelicans vulned; on a chief three mullets;
crest, a dexter hand grasping a golf-club; together with the
motto&mdash;dear to all golfers&mdash;<span class="smcap">Far and Sure</span>.</p>

<p>It must be admitted there is some uncertainty about this tale.
The house, the inscriptions, and arms only indicate that Paterson
built the house after being a victor at golf, and that Pitcairn had
a hand in decorating it. One might even see, in the fact of the
epigram, as if a gentleman wit were indulging in a jest at the
expense of some simple plebeian, who held all notoriety honourable.
It might have been expected that if Paterson had been enriched
by a match in which he was connected with the Duke of York, a
Jacobite like Pitcairn would have made distinct allusion to the
circumstance. The tradition, nevertheless, seems too curious to
be entirely overlooked, and the reader may therefore take it at
its worth.</p>

<h2><a name="LOTHIAN_HUT" id="LOTHIAN_HUT">[LOTHIAN HUT.</a></h2>


<p>The noble family of Lothian had a mansion in Edinburgh,
though of but a moderate dignity. It was a small house
situated in a spare piece of ground at the bottom of the Canongate,
on the south side. Latterly it was leased to Professor Dugald
Stewart, who, about the end of the last century, here entertained
several English pupils of noble rank&mdash;among others, the Hon.
the Henry Temple, afterwards Lord Palmerston.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> About 1825
building was taken down to make room for a brewery.</p>

<p>About the middle of the last century, Lothian Hut was
occupied by the wife of the fourth marquis, a lady of great
lineage, being the only daughter of Robert, Earl of Holderness,
and great-granddaughter of Charles Louis, Elector Palatine.
Her ladyship was a person of grand character, while yet
admittedly very amiable. As a piece of very old gossip, the
Lady Marchioness, on first coming to live in the Hut, found
herself in want of a few trifling articles from a milliner, and
sent for one who was reputed to be the first of the class then
in Edinburgh&mdash;namely, Miss Ramsay. But there were two
Miss Ramsays. They had a shop on the east side of the Old
Lyon Close, on the south side of the High Street, and there
made ultimately a little fortune, which enabled them to build
the villa of Marionville, near Restalrig (called <em>Lappet Hall</em> by
the vulgar). The Misses Ramsay, receiving a message from so
grand a lady, instead of obeying the order implicitly, came
together, dressed out in a very splendid style, and told the
marchioness that every article they wore was ‘at the very top
of the fashion.’ The marchioness, disgusted with their forwardness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
and affectation, said she would take their specimens into
consideration, and wished them a good-morning. According to
our gossiping authority, she then sent for Mrs Sellar, who carried
on the millinery business in a less pretentious style at a place
in the Lawnmarket where Bank Street now stands. (I like the
localities, for they bring the Old Town of a past age so clearly
before us.) Mrs Sellar made her appearance at Lothian Hut in
a plain, decorous manner. Her head-dress consisted of a mob-cap
of the finest lawn, tied under her chin; over which there
was a hood of the same stuff. She wore a cloak of plain black
silk without any lace, and had no bonnet, the use of which was
supplied by the hood. Mrs Sellar’s manners were elegant and
pleasing. When she entered, the marchioness rose to receive
her. On being asked for her patterns, she stepped to the door
and brought in two large boxes, which had been carried behind
her by two women. The articles, being produced, gave great
satisfaction, and her ladyship never afterwards employed any
other milliner. So the story ends, in the manner of the good-boy
books, in establishing that milliners ought not to be too
prone to exhibit their patterns upon their own persons.]</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_PRENTICE_AND_POTATOES" id="HENRY_PRENTICE_AND_POTATOES">HENRY PRENTICE AND POTATOES.</a></h2>


<p>No doubt is entertained on any hand that the field-culture of
the potato was first practised in Scotland by a man of
humble condition, originally a pedlar, by name Henry Prentice.
He was an eccentric person, as many have been who stepped out
of the common walk to do things afterwards discovered to be great.
A story is told that while the potatoes were growing in certain
little fields which he leased near our city, Lord Minto came
from time to time to inquire about the crop. Prentice at length
told his lordship that the experiment was entirely successful, and
all he wanted was a horse and cart to drive his potatoes to
Edinburgh that they might be sold. ‘I’ll give you a horse and
cart,’ said his lordship. Prentice then took his crop to market,
cart by cart, till it was all sold, after which he disposed of <em>the
horse and cart</em>, which he affected to believe Lord Minto had
given him as a present.</p>

<p>Having towards the close of his days realised a small sum
of money, he sunk £140 in the hands of the Canongate magistrates,
as managers of the poorhouse of that parish, receiving in
return seven shillings a week, upon which he lived for several
years. Occasionally he made little donations to the charity.
During his last years he was an object of no small curiosity in
Edinburgh, partly on account of his connection with potato
culture and partly by reason of his oddities. It was said of
him that he would never shake hands with any human being
above two years of age. In his bargain with the Canongate
dignitaries, it was agreed that he should have a <em>good grave</em> in
their churchyard, and one was selected according to his own
choice. Over this, thinking it as well, perhaps, that he should
enjoy a little quasi-posthumous notoriety during his life, he
caused a monument to be erected, bearing this inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Be not anxious to know how I lived,</div>
<div class="verse">But rather how you yourself should die.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He also had a coffin prepared at the price of two guineas, taking
the undertaker bound to screw it down gratis with his own
hands. In addition to all this, his friends the magistrates were
under covenant to bury him with a hearse and four coaches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
But even the designs of mortals respecting the grave itself are
liable to disappointment. Owing to the mischief done by the
boys to the premature monument, Prentice saw fit to have it
removed to a quieter cemetery, that of Restalrig, where, at his
death in 1788, he was accordingly interred.</p>

<p>Such was the originator of that extensive culture of the potato
which has since borne so conspicuous a place in the economics
of our country, for good and for evil.</p>

<p>It is curious that this plant, although the sole support of
millions of our population, should now again (1846) have fallen
under suspicion. At its first introduction, and for several ages
thereafter, it was regarded as a vegetable of by no means good
character, though for a totally different reason from any which
affect its reputation in our day. Its supposed tendency to inflame
some of the sensual feelings of human nature is frequently
adverted to by Shakespeare and his contemporaries; and this long
remained a popular impression in the north.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_DUCHESS_OF_BUCCLEUCH_AND_MONMOUTH" id="THE_DUCHESS_OF_BUCCLEUCH_AND_MONMOUTH">THE DUCHESS OF BUCCLEUCH AND MONMOUTH.</a></h2>


<p>It is rather curious that one of my informants in this article
should have dined with a lady who had dined with a peeress
married in the year 1662.</p>

<p>This peeress was Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth,
the wife of the unfortunate son of Charles II. As is well known,
she was early deserted by her husband, who represented, not
without justice, that a marriage into which he had been tempted
for reasons of policy by his relations, when he was only thirteen
years of age, could hardly be binding.</p>

<p>The young duchess, naturally plain in features, was so unfortunate
in early womanhood as to become lame in consequence
of some feats in dancing. For her want of personal graces there
is negative evidence in a dedication of Dryden, where he speaks
abundantly of her wit, but not a word of beauty, which shows
that the case must have been desperate. [This, by the way,
was the remark made to me on the subject by Sir Walter Scott,
who, in the <cite>Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite>, has done what Dryden could
not do&mdash;flattered the duchess:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="wideverse indent6">‘She had known adversity,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Though born in such a high degree;</div>
<div class="wideverse">In pride of power and <em>beauty’s bloom</em>,</div>
<div class="wideverse">Had wept o’er Monmouth’s bloody tomb.’]</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Were any further proof wanting, it might be found in the regard
in which she was held by James II., who, as is well known, had
such a tendency to plain women as induced a suspicion in his
witty brother that they were prescribed to him by his confessor
by way of penance. This friendship, in which there was nothing
improper, was the means of saving her grace’s estates at the
tragical close of her husband’s life.</p>

<p>It is curious to learn that the duchess, notwithstanding the
terms on which she had been with her husband, and the sad
stamp put upon his pretensions to legitimacy, acted throughout
the remainder of her somewhat protracted life as if she had been
the widow of a true prince of the blood-royal. In her state-rooms
she had a canopy erected, beneath which was the only seat
in the apartment, everybody standing besides herself. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
Lady Margaret Montgomery, one of the beautiful Countess of
Eglintoune’s daughters, was at a boarding-school near London&mdash;previous
to the year <em>Thirty</em>&mdash;she was frequently invited by the
duchess to her house; and because her great-grandmother, Lady
Mary Leslie, was sister to her grace’s mother, <em>she</em> was allowed
a chair; but this was an extraordinary mark of grace. The
duchess was the last person of quality in Scotland who kept
<em>pages</em>, in the proper acceptation of the term&mdash;that is, young
gentlemen of good birth, who acquired manners and knowledge
of the world in attending upon persons of exalted rank. The
last of her grace’s pages rose to be a general. When a letter
was brought for the duchess, the domestic gave it to the page,
the page to the waiting-gentlewoman (always a person of birth
also), and she at length to her grace. The duchess kept a
tight hand over her clan and tenants, but was upon the whole
beloved.</p>

<p>She was buried (1732) on the same day with the too-much-celebrated
Colonel Charteris. At the funeral of Henry, Duke
of Buccleuch, in the year 1812, in the aisle of the church at
Dalkeith, my informant (Sir Walter Scott) was shown an old
man who had been at the funeral of both her grace and Colonel
Charteris. He said that the day was dreadfully stormy, which
all the world agreed was owing to the devil carrying off Charteris.
The mob broke in upon the mourners who followed this personage
to the grave, and threw cats, dogs, and a pack of cards upon the
coffin; whereupon the gentlemen drew their swords, and cut away
among the rioters. In the confusion one little old man was
pushed into the grave; and the sextons, somewhat prompt in the
discharge of their duty, began to shovel in the earth upon the
quick and the dead. The grandfather of my informant (Dr
Rutherford), who was one of the mourners, was much hurt in
the affray; and my informant has heard his mother describe the
terror of the family on his coming home with his clothes bloody
and his sword broken.</p>

<p>As to pages&mdash;a custom existed among old ladies till a later
day of keeping such attendants, rather superior to the little
polybuttoned personages who are now so universal. It was not,
however, to be expected that a pranksome youth would behave
with consistent respect to an aged female of the stiff manners
then prevalent. Accordingly, ridiculous circumstances took place.
An old lady of the name of Plenderleith, of very stately aspect
and grave carriage, used to walk to Leith by the Easter Road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
with her little foot-page behind her. For the whole way, the
young rogue would be seen projecting burs at her dress, laughing
immoderately, but silently, when one stuck. An old lady and
her sequel of a page was very much like a tragedy followed by a
farce. The keeping of the rascals in order at home used also to
be a sad problem to a quiet old lady. The only expedient which
Miss &mdash;&mdash; could hit upon to preserve her page from the corruption
of the streets was, in her own phrase, to <em>lock up his breeks</em>,
which she did almost every evening. The youth, being then only
presentable at a window, had to content himself with such chat
as he could indulge in with his companions and such mischief as
he could execute from that loophole of retreat. So much for the
parade of keeping pages.</p>

<h2><a name="CLAUDERO" id="CLAUDERO">CLAUDERO.</a></h2>


<p>Edinburgh, which now smiles complacently upon the gravities
of her reviews and the flippancies of her magazines, formerly
laughed outright at the coarse lampoons of her favourite poet
and pamphleteer, Claudero. The distinct publications of this
witty and eccentric personage (whose real name was James Wilson)
are well known to collectors; and his occasional pieces must be
fresh in the remembrance of those who, forty or fifty years ago
(1824), were in the habit of perusing the <cite>Scots Magazine</cite>, amidst
the general gravity of which they appeared, like the bright and
giddy eyes of a satyr, staring through the sere leaves of a sober
forest scene.</p>

<p>Claudero was a native of Cumbernauld, in Dumbartonshire,
and at an early period of his life showed such marks of a mischief-loving
disposition as procured him general odium. The occasion
of his lameness was a pebble thrown from a tree at the minister,
who, having been previously exasperated by his tricks, chased him
to the end of a closed lane, and with his cane inflicted such
personal chastisement as rendered him a cripple, and a hater of
the clergy, for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh, where he lived for upwards of thirty years
previous to his death in 1789, his livelihood was at first ostensibly
gained by keeping a little school, latterly by celebrating
what were called <em>half-mark marriages</em>&mdash;a business resembling that
of the Gretna blacksmith. It is said that he, who made himself
the terror of so many by his wit, was in his turn held in fear by
his wife, who was as complete a shrew as ever fell to the lot of
poet or philosopher.</p>

<p>He was a satirist by profession; and when any person wished
to have a squib played off upon his neighbours, he had nothing
to do but call upon Claudero, who, for half a crown, would
produce the desired effusion, composed, and copied off in a fair
hand, in a given time. He liked this species of employment
better than writing upon speculation, the profit being more
certain and immediate. When in want of money, it was his
custom to write a sly satire on some opulent public personage,
upon whom he called with it, desiring to have his opinion of the
work, and his countenance in favour of a subscription for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
publication. The object of his ridicule, conscious-struck by his
own portrait, would wince and be civil, advise him to give up
thoughts of publishing so hasty a production, and conclude by
offering a guinea or two to keep the poet alive till better times
should come round. At that time there lived in Edinburgh a
number of rich old men who had made fortunes in questionable
ways abroad, and whose characters, labouring under strange
suspicions, were wonderfully susceptible of Claudero’s satire.
These the wag used to bleed profusely and frequently by working
upon their fears of public notice.</p>

<p>In 1766 appeared <cite>Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, by Claudero,
Son of Nimrod the Mighty Hunter, &amp;c., &amp;c.</cite>, opening with this
preface: ‘Christian Reader&mdash;The following miscellany is published
at the desire of many gentlemen, who have all been my
very good friends; if there be anything in it amusing or entertaining,
I shall be very glad I have contributed to your diversion,
and will laugh as heartily at your money as you do at my works.
Several of my pieces may need explanation; but I am too
cunning for that: what is not understood, like Presbyterian
preaching, will at least be admired. I am regardless of critics;
perhaps some of my lines want a foot; but then, if the critic
look sharp out, he will find that loss sufficiently supplied in other
places, where they have a foot too much: and besides, men’s
works generally resemble themselves; if the poems are lame, so
is the author&mdash;<span class="smcap">Claudero</span>.’</p>

<p>The most remarkable poems in this volume are: ‘The Echo
of the Royal Porch of the Palace of Holyrood House, which
fell under Military Execution, anno 1753;’ ‘The Last Speech
and Dying Words of the Cross, which was Hanged, Drawn, and
Quartered on Monday the 15th of March 1756, for the horrid
crime of being an Incumbrance to the Street;’ ‘Scotland in
Tears for the horrid Treatment of the Kings’ Sepulchres;’ ‘An
Elegy on the much-lamented Death of Quaker Erskine;’<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> ‘A
Sermon on the Condemnation of the Netherbow;’ ‘Humphry
Colquhoun’s Last Farewell,’ &amp;c. Claudero seems to have been
the only man of his time who remonstrated against the destruction
of the venerable edifices then removed from the streets which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
ornamented, to the disappointment and indignation of all future
antiquaries. There is much wit in his sermon upon the destruction
of the Netherbow. ‘What was too hard,’ he says, ‘for the great
ones of the earth, yea, even queens, to effect, is now accomplished.
No patriot duke opposeth the scheme, as did the great Argyll in
the grand senate of our nation; therefore the project shall go into
execution, and down shall Edina’s lofty porches be hurled with a
vengeance. Streets shall be extended to the east, regular and
beautiful, as far as the Frigate Whins; and Portobello<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> shall
be a lodge for the captors of tea and brandy. The city shall be
joined to Leith on the north, and a procession of wise masons
shall there lay the foundations of a spacious harbour. Pequin or
Nanquin shall not be able to compare with Edinburgh for magnificence.
Our city shall be the greatest wonder of the world, and
the fame of its glory shall reach the distant ends of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
But lament, O thou descendant of the royal Dane, and chief of
the tribe of Wilson; for thy shop, contiguous to the porch, shall
be dashed to pieces, and its place will know thee no more! No
more shall the melodious voice of the loyalist Grant<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> be heard
in the morning, nor shall he any more shake the bending wand
towards the triumphal arch. Let all who angle in deep waters
lament, for Tom had not his equal. The Netherbow Coffee-house
of the loyal Smeiton can now no longer enjoy its ancient name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
with propriety; and from henceforth <em>The Revolution Coffee-house</em>
shall its name be called. Our gates must be extended wide for
accommodating the gilded chariots, which, from the luxury of
the age, are become numerous. With an impetuous career, they
jostle against one another in our streets, and the unwary foot-passenger
is in danger of being crushed to pieces. The loaded
cart itself cannot withstand their fury, and the hideous yells of
<em>Coal Johnie</em> resound through the vaulted sky. The sour-milk
barrels are
overturned,
and deluges of
Corstorphin
cream run
down our
strands, while
the poor unhappy
milkmaid
wrings
her hands
with sorrow.’
To the sermon
are appended
the ‘Last
Speech and
Dying Words
of the Netherbow,’
in which
the following
laughable declaration
occurs:
‘May
my clock be
struck dumb
in the other
world, if I lie in this! and may <span class="smcap">Mack</span>, the reformer of Edina’s
lofty spires, never bestride my weathercock on high, if I deviate
from truth in these my last words! Though my fabric shall be
levelled with the dust of the earth, yet I fall in hope that my
weathercock shall be exalted on some more modern dome, where it
shall shine like the burnished gold, reflecting the rays of the sun
to the eye of ages unborn. The daring Mack shall yet look down
from my cock, high in the airy region, to the brandy-shops below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
where large graybeards shall appear to him no bigger than
mutchkin-bottles, and mutchkin-bottles shall be in his sight like
the spark of a diamond.’ One of Claudero’s versified compositions,
‘Humphry Colquhoun’s Farewell,’ is remarkable as a kind of
coarse prototype of the beautiful lyric entitled ‘Mary,’ sung in
<cite>The Pirate</cite> by Claud Halcro. One wonders to find the genius of
Scott refining upon such materials:</p>

<p>It is not unworthy of notice that the publication of Dr Blair’s
<cite>Lectures on Rhetoric and the Belles-lettres</cite> was hastened by Claudero,
who, having procured notes taken by some of the students,
avowed an intention of giving these to the world. The reverend
author states in his preface that he was induced to publish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
lectures in consequence of some surreptitious and incorrect copies
finding their way to the public; but it has not hitherto been told
that this doggerel-monger was the person chiefly concerned in
bringing about that result.</p>

<p>Claudero occasionally dealt in whitewash as well as blackball,
and sometimes wrote regular panegyrics. An address of this
kind to a <em>writer</em> named Walter Fergusson, who built St James’s
Square, concludes with a strange association of ideas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘May Pentland Hills pour forth their springs,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To water all thy square!</div>
<div class="verse">May Fergussons still bless the place,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Both gay and debonnair!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the said square was in progress, however, the water seemed
in no hurry to obey the bard’s invocation; and an attempt was
made to procure this useful element by sinking wells for it,
despite the elevation of the ground. Mr Walter Scott, W.S.,
happened one day to pass when Captain Fergusson of the Royal
Navy&mdash;a good officer, but a sort of Commodore Trunnion in his
manners&mdash;was sinking a well of vast depth. Upon Mr Scott
expressing a doubt if water could be got there, ‘I will get it,’
quoth the captain, ‘though I sink to hell for it!’ ‘A bad place
for water,’ was the dry remark of the doubter.</p>

<h2><a name="QUEENSBERRY_HOUSE" id="QUEENSBERRY_HOUSE">QUEENSBERRY HOUSE.</a></h2>


<p>In the Canongate, on the south side, is a large, gloomy building,
enclosed in a court, and now used as a refuge for destitute
persons. This was formerly the town mansion of the Dukes of
Queensberry, and a scene, of course, of stately life and high
political affairs. It was built by the first duke, the willing
minister of the last two Stuarts&mdash;he who also built Drumlanrig
Castle in Dumfriesshire, which he never slept in but one night,
and with regard to which it is told that he left the accounts for
the building tied up with this inscription: ‘The deil pyke out
his een that looks herein!’ Duke William was a noted money-maker
and land-acquirer. No little laird of his neighbourhood
had any chance with him for the retention of his family property.
He was something still worse in the eyes of the common people&mdash;a
<em>persecutor</em>; that is, one siding against the Presbyterian
cause. There is a story in one of their favourite books of his
having died of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morbus pediculosus</i>, by way of a judgment
upon him for his wickedness. In reality, he died of some ordinary
fever. It is also stated, from the same authority, that about the
time when his grace died, a Scotch skipper, being in Sicily, saw
one day a coach-and-six driving to Mount Etna, while a diabolic
voice exclaimed: ‘Open to the Duke of Drumlanrig!’&mdash;‘which
proves, by the way,’ says Mr Sharpe, ‘that the devil’s porter is
no herald. In fact,’ adds this acute critic, ‘the legend is borrowed
from the story of Antonio the Rich, in George Sandys’s <cite>Travels</cite>.’<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>It appears, from family letters, that the first duchess often
resided in the Canongate mansion, while her husband occupied
Sanquhar Castle. The lady was unfortunately given to drink,
and there is a letter of hers in which she pathetically describes
her situation to a country friend, left alone in Queensberry House
with only a few bottles of wine, one of which, having been drawn,
had turned out sour. Sour wine being prejudicial to her health,
it was fearful to think of what might prove the quality of the
remaining bottles.</p>

<p>The son of this couple, James, second duke, must ever be
memorable as the main instrument in carrying through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
Union. His character has been variously depicted. By Defoe,
in his <cite>History of the Union</cite>, it is liberally panegyrised. ‘I think
I have,’ says he, ‘given demonstrations to the world that I will
flatter no man.’ Yet he could not refrain from extolling the
‘prudence, calmness, and temper’ which the duke showed during
that difficult crisis. Unfortunately the author of <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite>, though not a flatterer, could not insure himself against
the usual prepossessions of a partisan. Boldness the duke must
certainly have possessed, for during the ferments attending the
parliamentary proceedings on that occasion, he continued daily
to drive between his lodgings in Holyrood and the Parliament
House, notwithstanding several intimations that his life was
threatened. His grace’s eldest son, James, was an idiot of the
most unhappy sort&mdash;rabid and gluttonous, and early grew to an
immense height, which is testified by his coffin in the family
vault at Durisdeer, still to be seen, of great length and unornamented
with the heraldic follies which bedizen the violated remains
of his relatives. A tale of mystery and horror is preserved by
tradition respecting this monstrous being. While the family
resided in Edinburgh, he was always kept confined in a ground
apartment, in the western wing of the house, upon the windows
of which, till within these few years, the boards still remained
by which the dreadful receptacle was darkened to prevent the
idiot from looking out or being seen. On the day the Union
was passed, all Edinburgh crowded to the Parliament Close to
await the issue of the debate, and to mob the chief promoters
of the detested measure on their leaving the House. The whole
household of the commissioner went <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, with perhaps a
somewhat different object, and among the rest was the man whose
duty it was to watch and attend Lord Drumlanrig. Two members
of the family alone were left behind&mdash;the madman himself, and a
little kitchen-boy who turned the spit. The insane being, hearing
everything unusually still around, the house being deserted, and
the Canongate like a city of the dead, and observing his keeper
to be absent, broke loose from his confinement, and roamed wildly
through the house. It is supposed that the savoury odour of the
preparations for dinner led him to the kitchen, where he found
the little turnspit quietly seated by the fire. He seized the boy,
killed him, took the meat from the fire, and spitted the body of
his victim, which he half-roasted, and was found devouring when
the duke, with his domestics, returned from his triumph. The
idiot survived his father many years, though he did not succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
him upon his death in 1711, when the titles devolved upon
Charles, the younger brother. He is known to have died in
England. This horrid act of his child was, according to the
common sort of people, the judgment of God upon him for his
wicked concern in the Union&mdash;the greatest blessing, as it has
happened, that ever was conferred upon Scotland by any statesman.</p>

<p>Charles, third Duke of Queensberry, who was born in Queensberry
House, resided occasionally in it when he visited Scotland;
but as he was much engaged in attending the court during the
earlier part of his life, his stay here was seldom of long continuance.
After his grace and the duchess embroiled themselves
with the court (1729), on account of the support which they gave
to the poet Gay, they came to Scotland, and resided for some time
here. The author of the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite> accompanied them, and
remained about a month, part of which was given to Dumfriesshire.
Tradition in Edinburgh
used to point out
an attic in an old house
opposite to Queensberry
House, where, as an appropriate
abode for a poet, his
patrons are said to have
stowed him. It was said he
wrote the <cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>
there&mdash;an entirely gratuitous
assumption. In the progress
of the history of his writings,
nothing of consequence occurs
at this time. He had
finished the second part of
the opera a short while
before. After his return to
the south, he is found engaged
in ‘new writing a
damned play, which he wrote
several years before, called
<cite>The Wife of Bath</cite>; a task
which he accomplished while
living with the Duke of
Queensberry in Oxfordshire, during the ensuing months of August,
September, and October.’<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> It is known, however, that while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
Edinburgh, he haunted the shop of Allan Ramsay, in the Luckenbooths&mdash;the
flat above that well-remembered and classical shop so
long kept by Mr Creech,
from which issued the
<cite>Mirror</cite>, <cite>Lounger</cite>, and
other works of name, and
where for a long course
of years all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i> of
Edinburgh used to assemble
every day, like

amused Gay by pointing
out to him the chief
public characters of the
city as they met in the
forenoon at the Cross.
Here, too, Gay read the
<cite>Gentle Shepherd</cite>, and
studied the Scottish language,
so that upon his
return to England he was
enabled to make Pope
appreciate the beauties of that delightful pastoral. He is said
also to have spent some of his time with the sons of mirth and
humour in an alehouse opposite to Queensberry House, kept by
one Janet Hall. <em>Jenny Ha’s</em>, as the place was called, was a noted
house for drinking claret from the butt within the recollection of
old gentlemen living in my time.</p>

<p>While Gay was at Drumlanrig, he employed himself in picking
out a great number of the best books from the library, which were
sent to England, whether for his own use or the duke’s is not

<p>Duchess Catherine was a most extraordinary lady, eccentric to
a degree undoubtedly bordering on madness. Her beauty has
been celebrated by Pope not in very elegant terms:</p>

<p>It is an undoubted fact that, before her marriage, she had been
confined in a <em>strait-jacket</em> on account of mental derangement; and
her conduct in married life was frequently such as to entitle her
to a repetition of the same treatment. She was, in reality, at
all times to a certain extent insane, though the politeness of
fashionable society and the flattery of her poetical friends seem
to have succeeded in passing off her extravagances as owing to an
agreeable freedom of carriage and vivacity of mind. Her brother
was as clever and as mad as herself, and used to amuse himself by
hiding a book in his library, and hunting for it after he had forgot
where it was deposited.</p>

<p>Her grace was no admirer of Scottish manners. One of their
habits she particularly detested&mdash;the custom of eating off the end
of a knife. When people dined with her at Drumlanrig, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
began to lift their food in this manner, she used to scream out
and beseech them not to cut their throats; and then she would
confound the offending persons by sending them a silver spoon or
fork upon a salver.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>When in Scotland her grace always dressed herself in the garb
of a peasant-girl. Her object seems to have been to ridicule and
put out of countenance the stately dresses and demeanour of the
Scottish gentlewomen who visited her. One evening some country
ladies paid her a visit, dressed in their best brocades, as for some
state occasion. Her grace proposed a walk, and they were of
course under the necessity of trooping off, to the utter discomfiture
of their starched-up frills and flounces. Her grace at last pretended
to be tired, sat down upon the dirtiest dunghill she could
find, at the end of a farmhouse, and saying, ‘Pray, ladies, be
seated,’ invited her poor draggled companions to plant themselves
round about her. They stood so much in awe of her that they
durst not refuse; and of course her grace had the satisfaction of
afterwards laughing at the destruction of their silks.</p>

<p>When she went out to an evening entertainment, and found a
tea-equipage paraded which she thought too fine for the rank of
the owner, she would contrive to overset the table and break the
china. The forced politeness of her hosts on such occasions, and
the assurances which they made her grace that no harm was done,
&amp;c., delighted her exceedingly.</p>

<p>Her custom of dressing like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paysanne</i> once occasioned her
grace a disagreeable adventure at a review. On her attempting
to approach the duke, the guard, not knowing her rank or relation
to him, pushed her rudely back. This threw her into such a
passion that she could not be appeased till his grace assured her
that the men had all been soundly flogged for their insolence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span></p>

<p>An anecdote scarcely less laughable is told of her grace as
occurring at court, where she carried to the same extreme her
attachment to plain-dealing and plain-dressing. An edict had
been issued forbidding the ladies to appear at the drawing-room
in aprons. This was disregarded by the duchess, whose rustic
costume would not have been complete without that piece of dress.
On approaching the door she was stopped by the lord in waiting,
who told her that he could not possibly give her grace admission
in that guise, when she, without a moment’s hesitation, stripped
off her apron, threw it in his lordship’s face, and walked on, in her
brown gown and petticoat, into the brilliant circle!</p>

<p>Her caprices were endless. At one time when a ball had been
announced at Drumlanrig, after the company were all assembled
her grace took a headache, declared that she could bear no noise,
and sat in a chair in the dancing-room, uttering a thousand peevish
complaints. Lord Drumlanrig, who understood her humour, said:
‘Madam, I know how to cure you;’ and taking hold of her
immense elbow-chair, which moved on castors, rolled her several
times backwards and forwards across the saloon, till she began
to laugh heartily&mdash;after which the festivities were allowed to
commence.</p>

<p>The duchess certainly, both in her conversation and letters,
displayed a great degree of wit and quickness of mind. Yet
nobody perhaps, saving Gay, ever loved her. She seems to have
been one of those beings who are too much feared, admired, or
envied, to be loved.</p>

<p>The duke, on the contrary, who was a man of ordinary mind,
had the affection and esteem of all. His temper and dispositions
were sweet and amiable in the extreme. His benevolence, extending
beyond his fellow-creatures, was exercised even upon his old
horses, none of which he would ever permit to be killed or sold.
He allowed the veterans of his stud free range in some parks near
Drumlanrig, where, retired from active life, they got leave to die
decent and natural deaths. Upon his grace’s decease, however,
in 1778, these luckless pensioners were all put up to sale by his
heartless successor; and it was a painful sight to see the feeble
and pampered animals forced by their new masters to drag carts,
&amp;c., till they broke down and died on the roads and in the ditches.</p>

<p>Duke Charles’s eldest son, Lord Drumlanrig, was altogether
mad. He had contracted himself to one lady when he married
another. The lady who became his wife was a daughter of the
Earl of Hopetoun, and a most amiable woman. He loved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
tenderly, as she deserved; but owing to the unfortunate contract
which he had engaged in, they were never happy. They were
often observed in the beautiful pleasure-grounds at Drumlanrig
weeping bitterly together. These hapless circumstances had such
a fatal effect upon him that during a journey to London in 1754
he rode on before the coach in which the duchess travelled, and
shot himself with one of his own pistols. It was given out that
the pistol had gone off by chance.</p>

<p>There is just one other tradition of Drumlanrig to be noticed.
The castle, being a very large and roomy mansion, had of course
a ghost, said to be the spirit of a Lady Anne Douglas. This
unhappy phantom used to walk about the house, terrifying everybody,
with her head in one hand and her fan in the other&mdash;are
we to suppose, fanning her face?</p>

<p>On the death of the Good Duke, as he was called, in 1778, the
title and estates devolved on his cousin, the Earl of March, so
well remembered as a sporting character and debauchee of the old
school by the name of <em>Old Q.</em> In his time Queensberry House
was occupied by other persons, for he had little inclination to
spend his time in Scotland. And this brings to mind an anecdote
highly illustrative of the wretchedness of such a life as his. When
professing, towards the close of his days, to be eaten up with
ennui, and incapable of any longer taking an interest in anything,
it was suggested that he might go down to his Scotch estates and
live among his tenantry. ‘I’ve tried that,’ said the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> aristocrat;
‘it is not amusing.’ In 1801 he caused Queensberry House
to be stripped of its ornaments and sold. With fifty-eight fire-rooms,
and a gallery seventy feet long, besides a garden, it was
offered at the surprisingly low upset price of £900. The Government
purchased it for a barrack. Thus has passed away the [home
of the] Douglas of Queensberry from its old place in Edinburgh,
where doubtless the money-making duke thought it would stand
for ever.</p>

<h2><a name="TENNIS_COURT" id="TENNIS_COURT">TENNIS COURT.</a></h2>

<p class="chapter_summary"><strong>Early Theatricals&mdash;The Canongate Theatre&mdash;Digges and Mrs
Bellamy&mdash;A Theatrical Riot.</strong></p>


<p>‘Just without the Water-gate,’ says Maitland, ‘on the eastern
side of the street, was the Royal Tennis Court, anciently
called the Catchpel [from Cache, a game since called <em>Fives</em>, and a
favourite amusement in Scotland so early as the reign of James
IV.].’ The house&mdash;a long, narrow building with a court&mdash;was
burned down in modern times, and rebuilt for workshops. Yet
the place continues to possess some interest as connected with the
early and obscure history of the stage in Scotland, not to speak
of the tennis itself, which was a fashionable amusement in Scotland
in the seventeenth century, and here played by the Duke of York,
Law the financial schemer, and other remarkable persons.</p>

<p>The first known appearance of the post-reformation theatre in
Edinburgh was in the reign of King James VI., when several
companies came from London, chiefly for the amusement of the
Court, including one to which Shakespeare is known to have
belonged, though his personal attendance cannot be substantiated.
There was no such thing, probably, as a play acted in Edinburgh
from the departure of James in 1603 till the arrival of his grandson,
the Duke of York, in 1680.</p>

<p>Threatened by the Whig party in the House of Commons with
an exclusion from the throne of England on account of his adherence
to popery, this prince made use of his exile in Scotland
to conciliate the nobles, and attach them to his person. His
beautiful young wife, Mary of Modena, and his second daughter,
the <em>Lady Anne</em>, assisted by giving parties at the palace&mdash;where,
by the bye, tea was now first introduced into Scotland. Easy and
obliging in their manners, these ladies revived the entertainment
of the masque, and took parts themselves in the performance. At
length, for his own amusement and that of his friends, James had
some of his own company of players brought down to Holyrood
and established in a little theatre, which was fitted up in the
Tennis Court. On this occasion the remainder of the company
playing at Oxford apologised for the diminution of their strength
in the following lines written by Dryden:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span></p>

<div class="verse">Our brethren have from Thames to Tweed departed,</div>

<div class="verse">It might perhaps a new rebellion bring;</div>
<div class="verse">The Scot who wore it would be chosen king.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We learn from Fountainhall’s <cite>Diary</cite> that on the celebration of
the king’s birthday, 1681, the duke honoured the magistrates of
the city with his presence in the theatre&mdash;namely, this theatre in
the Tennis Court.</p>

<p>No further glimpse of our city’s theatrical history is obtained till
1705, when we find a Mr Abel announcing a concert in the Tennis
Court, under the patronage of the Duke of Argyll, then acting as
the queen’s commissioner to the Parliament. It is probable that
the concert was only a cloak to some theatrical representation.
This is the more likely from a tradition already mentioned of
some old members of the Spendthrift Club who once frequented
the tavern of a Mrs Hamilton, whose husband recollected having
attended the theatre in the Tennis Court at Holyrood House,
when the play was <cite>The Spanish Friar</cite>, and many members of the
Union Parliament were present in the house.</p>

<p>Theatrical amusements appear to have been continued at the
Tennis Court in the year 1710, if we are to place any reliance
upon the following anecdote: When Mrs Siddons came to Edinburgh
in 1784, the late Mr Alexander Campbell, author of the
<cite>History of Scottish Poetry</cite>, asked Miss Pitcairn, daughter of Dr
Pitcairn, to accompany him to one of the representations. The
old lady refused, saying with coquettish vivacity: ‘Laddie, wad
ye ha’e an auld lass like me to be running after the play-actors&mdash;me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
that hasna been at a theatre since I gaed wi’ papa to the
Canongate in the year <em>ten</em>?’ The theatre was in those days
encouraged chiefly by such Jacobites as Dr Pitcairn. It was
denounced by the clergy as a hotbed of vice and profanity.</p>

<p>After this we hear no more of the theatre in the Tennis Court.
The next place where the drama set up its head was in a house in
Carrubber’s Close, under the management of an Italian lady styled
Signora Violante, who paid two visits to Edinburgh. After her
came, in 1726, one Tony Alston, who set up his scenes in the same
house, and whose first prologue was written by Ramsay: it may
be found in the works of that poet. In 1727 the Society of High
Constables, of which Ramsay was then a member, endeavoured to
‘suppress the abominable stage-plays lately set up by Anthony
Alston.’<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Mr Alston played for a season or two, under the
fulminations of the clergy and a prosecution on their part in the
Court of Session.</p>


<h3>CANONGATE THEATRE.</h3>

<p>From a period subsequent to 1727 till after the year 1753,
the Tailors’ Hall in the Cowgate<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> was used as a theatre by
itinerating companies, who met with some success notwithstanding
the incessant hostility of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> It was a house which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
theatrical phrase, could hold from £40 to £45. A split in the
company here concerned led to the erection, in 1746-7, of a
theatre at the bottom of a close in the Canongate, nearly opposite
to the head of New Street. This house, capable of holding about
£70&mdash;the boxes being half-a-crown and pit one and sixpence&mdash;was
for several years the scene of good acting under Lee, Digges,
Mrs Bellamy, and Mrs Ward. We learn from Henry Mackenzie
that the tragedy of
<cite>Douglas</cite>, which first
appeared here in
1756, was most respectably
acted&mdash;the
two ladies above
mentioned playing
respectively Young
Norval and Lady
Randolph.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The
personal elegance of
Digges&mdash;understood
to be the natural
son of a man of rank&mdash;and
the beauty of
Mrs Bellamy were
a theme of interest
amongst old people
fifty years ago; but
their scandalous life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
was of course regarded with horror by the mass of respectable
society. They lived in a small country-house at Bonnington,
between Edinburgh and Leith. It is remembered that Mrs Bellamy
was extremely fond of singing-birds, and kept many about her.
When emigrating to Glasgow, she had her feathered favourites
carried by a porter all the way that they might not suffer from
the jolting of a carriage. Scotch people wondered to hear of ten
guineas being expended on this occasion. Persons under the social
ban for their irregular lives often win the love of individuals by
their benevolence and sweetness of disposition&mdash;qualities, it is
remarked, not unlikely to have been partly concerned in their first
trespasses. This was the case with Mrs Bellamy. Her waiting-maid,
Annie Waterstone, who is mentioned in her <cite>Memoirs</cite>, lived
many years after in Edinburgh, and continued to the last to adore
the memory of her mistress. Nay, she was, from this cause, a
zealous friend of all kinds of players, and never would allow a
slighting remark upon them to pass unreproved. It was curious
to find in a poor old Scotchwoman of the humbler class such a
sympathy with the follies and eccentricities of the children of
Thespis.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Tailors’ Hall, Cowgate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While under the temporary management of two Edinburgh
citizens extremely ill-qualified for the charge&mdash;one of them, by the
bye, a Mr David Beatt, who had read the rebel proclamations from
the Cross in 1745&mdash;a sad accident befell the Canongate playhouse.
Dissensions of a dire kind had broken out in the company. The
public, as usual, was divided between them. Two classes of persons&mdash;the
gentlemen of the bar and the students of the university<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>&mdash;were
especially zealous as partisans. Things were at that pass
when a trivial incident will precipitate them to the most fearful
conclusion. One night, when <cite>Hamlet</cite> was the play, a riot took
place of so desperate a description that at length the house was
set on fire. It being now necessary for the authorities to interfere,
the Town-guard was called forth, and marched to the scene of
disturbance; but though many of that veteran corps had faced the
worst at Blenheim and Dettingen, they felt it as a totally different
thing to be brought to action in a place which they regarded as a
peculiar domain of the Father of Evil. When ordered, therefore,
by their commander to advance into the house and across the stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
the poor fellows fairly stopped short amidst the scenes, the glaring
colours of which at once surprised and terrified them. Indignant
at their pusillanimity, the bold captain seized a musket, and
placing himself in an attitude equal to anything that had
ever appeared on those boards, exclaimed: ‘Now, my lads,
follow <em>me</em>!’ But just at the moment that he was going to
rush on and charge the rioters, a trap-door on which he
trod gave way, and in an instant the
heroic leader had sunk out of sight, as
if by magic. This was too much for
the excited nerves of the guard; they
immediately vacated the house, leaving
the devil to make his own of it; and
accordingly it was completely destroyed.
It is added that when the captain by-and-by
reappeared, they received him
in the quality of a gentleman from the
other world; nor could they all at
once be undeceived, even when he
cursed them in vigorous Gaelic for a
pack of cowardly scoundrels.</p>

<p>The Canongate theatre revived for
a short time, and had the honour to
be the first house in our city in which
the drama was acted with a license.
It was opened with this privilege by
Mr Ross on the 9th December 1767,
when the play was <cite>The Earl of Essex</cite>,
and a general prologue was spoken,
the composition of James Boswell.
Soon after, being deserted for the
present building in the New Town,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> it
fell into ruin; in which state it formed
the subject of a mock elegy to the
muse of Robert Fergusson. The
reader will perhaps be amused with the following extract from that
poem:</p>

</div>

<p>Between the eastern suburbs of Edinburgh and the village
of Restalrig stands a solitary house named Marionville,
enclosed in a shrubbery of no great extent, surrounded by high
walls. Whether it be that the place has become dismal in consequence
of the rise of a noxious fen in its neighbourhood,
or that the tale connected with it acts upon the
imagination, I cannot pretend
to decide, but unquestionably
there is about the house an
air of depression and melancholy
such as could scarcely
fail to strike the most unobservant
passenger. Yet, in
1790, this mansion was the
abode of a gay and fashionable
family, who, amongst
other amusements, indulged in
that of private theatricals, and
in this line were so highly successful that admission to the Marionville
theatre became a privilege for which the highest in the land
would contend. Mr Macrae, the head of this family, was a man
of good fortune, being the proprietor of an estate in Dumfriesshire,
and also of good connections&mdash;the Earl of Glencairn, whom Burns
has so much celebrated, being his cousin, while by his mother he
was nearly related to Viscount Fermoy and the celebrated Sir
Boyle Roche. He had been for some years retired from the Irish
Carabiniers, and being still in the prime of life, he was thinking of
again entering the army, when the incident which I am about to
relate took place. He was a man of gentlemanlike accomplishments
and manners, of a generous and friendly disposition, but marked
by a keen and imperious sense of the deference due to a gentleman,
and a heat of temper which was apt to make him commit actions
of which he afterwards bitterly repented. After the unfortunate
affair which ended his career in Scotland, the public, who never
make nice distinctions as to the character of individuals, adopted
the idea that he was as inhumane as rash, and he was reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
be an experienced duellist. But here he was greatly misrepresented.
Mr Macrae would have shrunk from a deliberate act of cruelty;
and the only connection he had ever had with single combat was
in the way of endeavouring to reconcile friends who had quarrelled&mdash;an
object in which he was successful on several memorable
occasions. But the same man&mdash;whom all that really knew him
allowed to be a delightful companion and kind-hearted man&mdash;was
liable to be transported beyond the bounds of reason by casual and
trivial occurrences. A messenger of the law having arrested the
Rev. Mr Cunningham, brother of the Earl of Glencairn, for debt,
as he was passing with a party from the drawing-room to the
dining-room at Drumsheugh House, Mr Macrae threw the man
over the stair. He was prompted to this act by indignation at the
affront which he conceived his cousin, as a gentleman, had received
from a common man. But soon after, when it was represented to
him that every other means of inducing Mr Cunningham to settle
his debt had failed, and when he learned that the messenger had
suffered severe injury, he went to him, made him a hearty apology,
and agreed to pay three hundred guineas by way of compensation.
He had himself allowed a debt due to a tailor to remain too long
unpaid, and the consequence was that he received a summons for
it before the sheriff-court. With this document in his hand, he
called, in a state of great excitement, upon his law-agent, to whom
he began to read: ‘Archibald Cockburn of Cockpen, sheriff-depute,’
&amp;c., till he came to a passage which declared that ‘he, the said
James Macrae, had been oft and diverse times desired and required,’
&amp;c. ‘The greatest lie ever uttered!’ he exclaimed. ‘He had
never heard a word of it before; he would instantly go to the
sheriff and horsewhip him.’ The agent had at the time letters of
<em>horning</em> against a very worthy baronet lying upon his table&mdash;that
is to say, a document in which the baronet was denounced as a
rebel to the king, according to a form of the law of Scotland, for
failing to pay his debt. The agent took up this, and coolly began
to read: ‘George III. by the grace of God,’ &amp;c. Macrae at once
saw the application, and fell a-laughing at his own folly, saying he
would go directly and give the sheriff tickets for the play at
Marionville, which he and his family requested. It will be seen
that the fault of this unfortunate gentleman was heat of temper,
not a savage disposition; but what fault can be more fatal than
heat of temper?</p>

<p>Mr Macrae was married to an accomplished lady, Maria Cecilia
le Maitre, daughter of the Baroness Nolken, wife of the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
ambassador. They occasionally resided in Paris, with Mrs Macrae’s
relations, particularly with her cousin, Madame de la Briche, whose
private theatricals in her elegant house at the Marais were the
models of those afterwards instituted at Marionville. It may not
be unworthy of notice that amongst their fellow-performers at
Madame de la Briche’s was the celebrated Abbé Sieyès. When
Mr Macrae and his lady set up their theatre at Marionville, they
both took characters, he appearing to advantage in such parts as
that of Dionysius in the <cite>Grecian Daughter</cite>, and she in the first line
of female parts in genteel comedy. Sir David Kinloch and a Mr
Justice were their best male associates; and the chief female
performer, after Mrs Macrae herself, was Mrs Carruthers of Dormont,
a daughter of the celebrated artist Paul Sandby. When all due
deduction is made for the effects of complaisance, there seems to
remain undoubted testimony that these performances involved no
small amount of talent.</p>

<p>In Mr and Mrs Macrae’s circle of visiting acquaintance, and
frequent spectators of the Marionville theatricals, were Sir George
Ramsay of Bamff and his lady. Sir George had recently returned,
with an addition to his fortune, from India, and was now settling
himself down for the remainder of life in his native country. I
have seen original letters between the two families, showing that
they lived on the most friendly terms and entertained the highest
esteem for each other. One written by Lady Ramsay to Mrs
Macrae, from Sir George’s country-seat in Perthshire, commences
thus: ‘My dear friend, I have just time to write you a few lines
to say how much I long to hear from you, and to assure you how
sincerely I love you.’ Her ladyship adds: ‘I am now enjoying
rural retirement with Sir George, who is really so good and
indulgent, that I am as happy as the gayest scenes could make me.
He joins me in kind compliments to you and Mr Macrae,’ &amp;c.
How deplorable that social affections, which contribute so much
to make life pass agreeably, should be liable to a wild upbreak
from perhaps some trivial cause, not in itself worthy of a moment’s
regard, and only rendered of consequence by the sensitiveness of
pride and a deference to false and worldly maxims!</p>

<p>The source of the quarrel between Mr Macrae and Sir George
was of a kind almost too mean and ridiculous to be spoken of.
On the evening of the 7th April 1790, the former gentleman
handed a lady out of the Edinburgh theatre, and endeavoured to
get a chair for her, in which she might be conveyed home. Seeing
two men approaching through the crowd with one, he called to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
if it was disengaged, to which the men replied with a distinct
affirmative. As Mr Macrae handed the lady forward to put her
into it, a footman, in a violent manner, seized hold of one of the
poles, and insisted that it was engaged for his mistress. The man
seemed disordered by liquor, and it was afterwards distinctly made
manifest that he was acting without the guidance of reason. His
lady had gone home some time before, while he was out of the way.
He was not aware of this, and, under a confused sense of duty, he
was now eager to obtain a chair for her, but in reality had not
bespoken that upon which he laid hold. Mr Macrae, annoyed at
the man’s pertinacity at such a moment, rapped him over the
knuckles with a short cane to make him give way; on which the
servant called him a scoundrel, and gave him a push on the breast.
Incensed overmuch by this conduct, Mr Macrae struck him smartly
over the head with his cane, on which the man cried out worse than
before, and moved off. Mr Macrae, following him, repeated his
blows two or three times, but only with that degree of force which
he thought needful for a chastisement. In the meantime the lady
whom Mr Macrae had handed out got into a different chair, and
was carried off. Some of the bystanders, seeing a gentleman beating
a servant, cried shame, and showed a disposition to take part with
the latter; but there were individuals present who had observed
all the circumstances, and who felt differently. One gentleman
afterwards gave evidence that he had been insulted by the servant,
at an earlier period of the evening, in precisely the same manner
as Mr Macrae, and that the man’s conduct had throughout been
rude and insolent, a consequence apparently of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Learning that the servant was in the employment of Lady
Ramsay, Mr Macrae came into town next day, full of anxiety
to obviate any unpleasant impression which the incident might
have made upon her mind. Meeting Sir George in the street, he
expressed to him his concern on the subject, when Sir George said
lightly that the man being his lady’s footman, he did not feel any
concern in the matter. Mr Macrae then went to apologise to Lady
Ramsay, whom he found sitting for her portrait in the lodgings of
the young artist Raeburn, afterwards so highly distinguished. It
has been said that he fell on his knees before the lady to entreat
her pardon for what he had done to her servant. Certainly he left
her with the impression that he had no reason to expect a quarrel
between himself and Sir George on account of what had taken
place.</p>

<p>James Merry&mdash;this was the servant’s name&mdash;had been wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
in the head, but not severely. The injuries which he had sustained&mdash;though
nothing can justify the violence which inflicted
them&mdash;were only of such a nature as a few days of confinement
would have healed. Such, indeed, was the express testimony
given by his medical attendant, Mr Benjamin Bell. There was,
however, a strong feeling amongst his class against Macrae, who
was informed, in an anonymous letter, that a hundred and seven
men-servants had agreed to have some revenge upon him. Merry
himself had determined to institute legal proceedings against Mr
Macrae for the recovery of damages. A process was commenced
by the issue of a summons, which Mr Macrae received on the 12th.
Wounded to the quick by this procedure, and smarting under the
insolence of the anonymous letter, Mr Macrae wrote next day a
note to Sir George Ramsay, in which, addressing him without any
term of friendly regard, he demanded that either Merry should
drop the prosecution or that his master should turn him off. Sir
George temperately replied ‘that he had only now heard of the
prosecution for the first time; that the man met with no encouragement
from him; and that he hoped that Mr Macrae, on further
consideration, would not think it incumbent on him to interfere,
especially as the man was at present far from being well.’</p>

<p>On the same evening Mr Amory, a military friend of Mr
Macrae, called upon Sir George with a second note from that
gentleman, once more insisting on the man being turned off, and
stating that in the event of his refusal Mr Amory was empowered
to communicate his opinion of his conduct. Sir George did
refuse, on the plea that he had yet seen no good reason for his
discharging the servant; and Mr Amory then said it was his duty
to convey Mr Macrae’s opinion, which was ‘that Sir George’s
conduct had not been that of a gentleman.’ Sir George then
said that further conversation was unnecessary; all that remained
was to agree upon a place of meeting. They met again that
evening at a tavern, where Mr Amory informed Sir George that
it was Mr Macrae’s wish that they should meet, properly attended,
next day at twelve o’clock at Ward’s Inn, on the borders of
Musselburgh Links.</p>

<p>The parties met there accordingly, Mr Macrae being attended
by Captain Amory, and Sir George Ramsay by Sir William
Maxwell; Mr Benjamin Bell, the surgeon, being also of the party.
Mr Macrae had brought an additional friend, a Captain Haig, to
favour them with his advice, but not to act formally as a second.
The two parties being in different rooms, Sir William Maxwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
came into that occupied by Mr Macrae, and proposed that if Mr
Macrae would apologise for the intemperate style of his letters
demanding the discharge of the servant, Sir George would grant
his request, and the affair would end. Mr Macrae answered that
he would be most happy to comply with this proposal if his
friends thought it proper; but he must abide by their decision.
The question being put to Captain Haig, he answered, in a
deliberate manner: ‘It is altogether impossible; Sir George must,
in the first place, turn off his servant, and Mr Macrae will then
apologise.’ Hearing this speech, equally marked by wrong
judgment and wrong feeling, Macrae, according to the testimony
of Mr Bell, shed tears of anguish. The parties then walked to
the beach, and took their places in the usual manner. On the
word being given, Sir George took deliberate aim at Macrae, the
neck of whose coat was grazed by his bullet. Macrae had, if his
own solemn asseveration is to be believed, intended to fire in the
air; but when he found Sir George aiming thus at his life, he
altered his resolution, and brought his antagonist to the ground
with a mortal wound in the body.</p>

<p>There was the usual consternation and unspeakable distress.
Mr Macrae went up to Sir George and ‘told him that he was
sincerely afflicted at seeing him in that situation.’<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It was with
difficulty, and only at the urgent request of Sir William Maxwell,
that he could be induced to quit the field. Sir George lingered
for two days. The event occasioned a great sensation in the
public mind, and a very unfavourable view was generally taken of
Mr Macrae’s conduct. It was given out that during a considerable
interval, while in expectation of the duel taking place, he
had practised pistol-shooting in his garden at a barber’s block;
and he was also said to have been provided with a pair of pistols
of a singularly apt and deadly character; the truth being that
the interval was a brief one, his hand totally unskilled in shooting,
and the pistols a bad brass-mounted pair, hastily furnished by
Amory. We have Amory’s testimony that as they were pursuing
their journey to another country, he was constantly bewailing the
fate of Sir George Ramsay, remarking how unfortunate it was
that he took so obstinate a view about the servant’s case. The
demand, he said, was one which he would have thought it
necessary to comply with. He had asked Sir George nothing but
what he would have done had it been his own case. This is so
consonant with what appears otherwise respecting his character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
that we cannot doubt it. It is only to be lamented that he should
not have made the demand in terms more calculated to lead to
compliance.</p>

<p>The death of an amiable man under such deplorable circumstances
roused the most zealous vigilance on the part of the law
authorities; but Mr Macrae and his second succeeded in reaching
France. A summons was issued for his trial, but he was advised
not to appear, and accordingly sentence of outlawry was passed
against him. The servant’s prosecution meanwhile went on, and
was ultimately decided against Mr Macrae, although, on a cool
perusal of the evidence on both sides, there appears to me the
clearest proof of Merry having been the first aggressor. Mr
Macrae lived in France till the progress of the Revolution forced
him to go to Altona. When time seemed to have a little softened
matters against him, he took steps to ascertain if he could safely
return to his native country. It was decided by counsel that he
could not. They held that his case entirely wanted the extenuating
circumstance which was necessary&mdash;his having to contemplate
degradation if he did not challenge. He was under no such
danger; so that, from his letters to Sir George Ramsay, he
appeared to have forced on the duel purely for revenge. He came
to see the case in this light himself, and was obliged to make up
his mind to perpetual self-banishment. He survived thirty years.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, who had known him in early life in
Scotland, was surprised to meet him one day in a Parisian coffee-house
after the peace of 1814&mdash;the wreck or ghost of the handsome,
sprightly man he had once been. The comfort of his home,
his country, and friends, the use of his talents to all these, had
been lost, and himself obliged to lead the life of a condemned
Cain, all through the one fault of a fiery temper.</p>

<h2><a name="ALISON_SQUARE" id="ALISON_SQUARE">ALISON SQUARE.</a></h2>


<p>This is a large mass of building between Nicolson Square and
the Potterrow, in the south side of the town. It was built
about the middle of the eighteenth century, upon venture, by one
Colin Alison, a joiner, who in after-life was much reduced in his
circumstances, not improbably in consequence of this large speculation.
In his last days he spent some of his few remaining
shillings in the erection of two boards, at different parts of his
buildings, whereon was represented a globe in the act of falling,
with this inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘If Fortune smile, be not puffed up,</div>
<div class="verse">And if it frown, be not dismayed;</div>
<div class="verse">For Providence governeth all,</div>
<div class="verse">Although the world’s turned upside down.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Alison Square<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> has enjoyed some little connection with the
Scottish muses. It was in the house of a Miss Nimmo in this
place that Burns met Clarinda. It would amuse the reader of
the ardent letters which passed between these two kindred souls
to visit the plain, small, dusky house in which the lady lived at
that time, and where she received several visits of the poet. It is
situated in the adjacent humble street called the Potterrow, the
first floor over the passage into General’s Entry, accessible by a
narrow spiral stair from the court. A little parlour, a bedroom,
and a kitchen constituted the accommodations of Mrs M’Lehose;
now the residence of two, if not three, families in the extreme of
humble life. Here she lived with a couple of infant children, a
young and beautiful woman, blighted in her prospects in consequence
of an unhappy marriage (her husband having deserted her,
after using her barbarously), yet cheerful and buoyant, through
constitutional good spirits and a rational piety. To understand
her friendship with Burns and the meaning of their correspondence,
it was almost necessary to have known the woman. Seeing
her and hearing her converse, even in advanced life, one could
penetrate the whole mystery very readily, in appreciating a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
unusually gay, frank, and emotional. The perfect innocence of the
woman’s nature was evident at once; and by her friends it was
never doubted.</p>

<p>In Alison Square Thomas Campbell lived while composing his
<cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>. The place where any deathless composition
took its shape from the author’s brain is worthy of a place in the
chart. A lady, the early friend of Campbell and his family,
indicates their residence at that time as being the second door in
the stair, entered from the east side, on the north side of the arch,
the windows looking partly into Nicolson Square and partly to the
Potterrow. The same authority states that much of the poem was
written in the middle of the night, and from a sad cause. The
poet’s mother, it seems, was of a temper so extremely irritable
that her family had no rest till she retired for the night. It was
only at that season that the young poet could command repose of
mind for his task.</p>

<h2><a name="LEITH_WALK" id="LEITH_WALK">LEITH WALK.</a></h2>


<p>Up to the period of the building of the North Bridge, which
connects the Old with the New Town of Edinburgh, the
Easter Road was the principal passage to Leith. The origin of
Leith Walk was accidental. At the approach of Cromwell to
Edinburgh, immediately before the battle of Dunbar, Leslie, the
Covenanting general, arranged the Scottish troops in a line, the
right wing of which rested upon the Calton Hill, and the left
upon Leith, being designed for the defence of these towns. A
battery was erected at each extremity, and the line was itself
defended by a trench and a mound, the latter composed of the
earth dug from the former. Leslie himself took up his head-quarters
at Broughton, whence some of his despatches are dated.
When the war was shifted to another quarter, this mound became
a footway between the two towns. It is thus described in a book
published in 1748: ‘A very handsome gravel walk, twenty feet
broad, which is kept in good repair at the public charge, and no
horses suffered to come upon it.’ When Provost Drummond built
the North Bridge in 1769, he contemplated that it should become
an access to Leith as well as to the projected New Town.
Indeed, he seems to have been obliged to make it pass altogether
under that semblance in order to conciliate the people; for upon
the plate sunk under the foundations of the bridge it is solely
described as the opening of a road to Leith. At that time the
idea of a New Town seemed so chimerical that he scarcely dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
to avow his patriotic intentions. After the opening of the bridge,
the <em>Walk</em> seems to have become used by carriages, but without
any regard being paid to its condition or any system established
for keeping it in repair. It consequently fell into a state of
disorder, from which it was not rescued till after the commencement
of the present century, when a splendid causeway was formed
at a great expense by the city of Edinburgh, and a toll erected for
its payment.</p>

<p>One terrible peculiarity attended Leith Walk in its former
condition. It was overhung by a gibbet, from which were suspended
all culprits whose bodies at condemnation were sentenced
to be hung in chains. The place where this gibbet stood, called
the Gallow Lee, is now a good deal altered in appearance. It was
a slight rising ground immediately above the site of the toll<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and
on the west side of the road, being now partly enclosed by the
precincts of a villa, where the beautiful Duchess of Gordon once
lived. The greater part of the Gallow Lee now exists in the
shape of mortar in the walls of the houses of the New Town. At
the time when that elegant city was built, the proprietor of this
redoubtable piece of ground, finding it composed of excellent sand,
sold it all away to the builders, to be converted into mortar, so
that it soon, from a rising ground, became a deep hollow. An
amusing anecdote is told in connection with this fact. The
honest man, it seems, was himself fully as much of a sand-bed
as his property. He was a big, voluminous man, one of those
persons upon whom drink never seems to have any effect. It is
related that every day, while the carts were taking away his sand,
he stood regularly at the place receiving the money in return, and
every little sum he got was immediately converted into liquor and
applied to the comfort of his inner man. A public-house was at
length erected at the spot for his particular behoof; and, assuredly,
as long as the Gallow Lee lasted this house did not want custom.
Perhaps, familiar as the reader may be with stories of sots who
have drunk away their last acre, he never before heard of the thing
being done in so literal a manner.</p>

<p>If my reader be an inhabitant of Edinburgh of any standing,
he must have many delightful associations of Leith Walk in
connection with his childhood. Of all the streets in Edinburgh
or Leith, the <em>Walk</em> in former times was certainly the street for
boys and girls. From top to bottom, it was a scene of wonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
and enjoyments peculiarly devoted to children. Besides the
panoramas and caravan-shows, which were comparatively transient
spectacles, there were several shows upon Leith Walk, which
might be considered as regular fixtures and part of the <em>country-cousin
sights</em> of Edinburgh. Who can forget the waxworks of
‘Mrs Sands, widow of the late G. Sands,’ which occupied a <em>laigh</em>
shop opposite to the present Haddington Place, and at the door
of which, besides various parrots and sundry birds of Paradise, sat
the wax figure of a little man in the dress of a French courtier of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, reading one eternal copy of the <cite>Edinburgh
Advertiser</cite>? The very outsides of these wonder-shops was an
immense treat; all along the Walk it was one delicious scene of
squirrels hung out at doors, and monkeys dressed like soldiers and
sailors, with holes behind where their tails came through. Even
the half-penniless boy might here get his appetite for wonders to
some extent gratified.</p>

<p>Besides being of old the chosen place for shows, Leith Walk
was the Rialto of <em>objects</em>. This word requires explanation. It is
applied by the people of Scotland to persons who have been born
with or overtaken by some miserable personal evil. From one
end to the other, Leith Walk was garrisoned by poor creatures
under these circumstances, who, from handbarrows, wheelbarrows,
or iron legs, if peradventure they possessed such adjuncts, entreated
the passengers for charity&mdash;some by voices of song, some by
speech, some by driddling, as Burns calls it, on fiddles or grinding
on hand-organs&mdash;indeed, a complete continuous ambuscade against
the pocket. Shows and <em>objects</em> have now alike vanished from
Leith Walk. It is now a plain street, composed of little shops of
the usual suburban appearance, and characterised by nothing
peculiar, except perhaps a certain air of pretension, which is
in some cases abundantly ludicrous. A great number, be it
observed, are mere tiled cottages, which contrive, by means of
lofty fictitious fronts, plastered and painted in a showy manner, to
make up a good appearance towards the street. If there be a
school in one of those receptacles, it is entitled an <em>academy</em>; if
an artisan’s workshop, however humble, it is a <em>manufactory</em>.
Everything about it is still showy and unsubstantial; it is still, in
some measure, the type of what it formerly was.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of Leith Walk is a row of somewhat old-fashioned
houses bearing the name of Springfield. A large one,
the second from the top, was, ninety years ago, the residence of
Mr M’Culloch of Ardwell, a commissioner of customs, and noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
as a man of pleasantry and wit. Here, in some of the last years
of his life, did Samuel Foote occasionally appear as Mr M’Culloch’s
guest&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcades ambo et respondere parati</i>. But the history of
their intimacy is worthy of being particularly told; so I transcribe
it from the recollection of a gentleman whose advanced age and
family connections could alone have made us faithfully acquainted
with circumstances so remote from our time.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1775-6 [more probably that of 1774-5], Mr
M’Culloch visited his country mansion in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright,
in company of a friend named Mouat, in order to be
present at an election. Mr M’Culloch was a man of joyous
temperament and a good deal of wit, and used to amuse his
friends by spouting half-random verses. He and his friend spent
a week or two very pleasantly in the country, and then set out
on their return to Leith; Mr M’Culloch carrying with him his
infant son David, familiarly called <em>Wee Davie</em>, for the purpose
of commencing his education in Edinburgh. To pursue the
narrative of my correspondent: ‘The two travellers got on pretty
well as far as Dumfries; but it was with difficulty, occasioned by
a snowstorm, that they reached Moffat, where they tarried for
the night.</p>

<p>‘Early on a January morning, the snow having fallen heavily
during the preceding night, they set off in a post-chaise and four
horses to proceed on their perilous journey. Two gentlemen in
their own carriage left the <em>King’s Arms Inn</em> (then kept by James
Little) at the same time. With difficulty the first pair of travellers
reached the top of Erickstane, but farther they could not go.
The parties came out of their carriages, and, aided by their
postillions, they held a consultation as to the prudence of attempting
to proceed down the vale of Tweed. This was considered as
a vain and dangerous attempt, and it was therefore determined
on to return to Moffat. The turning of the carriages having
become a dangerous undertaking, Wee Davie had to be taken out
of the chaise and laid on the snow, wrapped in a blanket, until
the business was accomplished. The parties then went back to
Moffat, arriving there between nine and ten in the morning. Mr
M’Culloch and his friend then learned that, of the two strangers
who had left the inn at the same time, and had since returned,
one was the celebrated Foote, and the other either Ross or Souter,
but which of the two favourite sons of Thalia I cannot remember
at this distant period of time. Let it be kept in mind that
Foote had lost a leg, and walked with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span></p>

<p>‘Immediately on returning Foote had entered the inn, not in
good-humour, to order breakfast. His carriage stood opposite
the inn door, in order to get the luggage taken off. While this
was going on a paper was placarded on one of the panels. The
wit came out to see how all matters were going on, when, observing
the paper, he in wrath exclaimed: “What rascal has been
placarding his ribaldry on my carriage?” He had patience,
however, to pause and read the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“While Boreas his flaky storm did guide,</div>
<div class="verse">Deep covering every hill, o’er Tweed and Clyde,</div>
<div class="verse">The north-wind god spied travellers seeking way;</div>
<div class="verse">Sternly he cried: ‘Retrace your steps, I say;</div>
<div class="verse">Let not <em>one foot</em>, ’tis my behest, profane</div>
<div class="verse">The sacred snows which lie on Erickstane.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The countenance of our wit now brightened, as he called out,
with an exclamation of surprise: “I should like to know the
fellow who wrote that; for, be he who he may, he’s no mean
hand at an epigram.” Mrs Little, the good but eccentric landlady,
now stepped forward and spoke thus: “Trouth, Maister
Fut, it’s mair than likely that it was our <em>frien’</em> Maister M’Culloch
of Ardwell that did it; it’s weel kent that he’s a poyet; he’s a
guid eneugh sort o’ man, but he never comes here without poyet-teasing
mysel’ or the guidman, or some are or other about the
house. It wud be weel dune if ye wud speak to him.” Ardwell
now came forward, muttering some sort of apology, which Foote
instantly stopped by saying: “My dear sir, an apology is not
necessary; I am fair game for every one, for I take any one for
game when it suits me. You and I must become acquainted,
for I find that we are brother-poets, and that we were this
morning companions in misfortune on ‘the sacred snows of Erickstane.’”
Thus began an intimacy which the sequel will show
turned out to be a lasting one. The two parties now joined at
the breakfast-table, as they did at every other meal for the next
twenty days.</p>

<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_364">Page 364.</a></span>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>‘Foote remained quiet for a few hours after breakfast, until he
had beat about for game, as he termed it, and he first fixed on
worthy Mrs Little, his hostess. By some occult means he had
managed to get hold of some of the old lady’s habiliments,
particularly a favourite night-cap&mdash;provincially, a <em>mutch</em>. After
attiring himself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> Mrs Little, he went into the kitchen and
through the house, mimicking the garrulous landlady so very
exactly in giving orders, scolding, &amp;c. that no servant doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
as to its being the mistress <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>. This kind of
amusement went on for several days for the benefit of the people
in Moffat. By-and-by the snow allowed the united parties to
advance as far as the Crook, upon Tweed, and here they were
again storm-stayed for ten days. Nevertheless, Foote and his
companion, who was well qualified to support him, never for a
moment flagged in creating merriment or affording the party
amusement of some sort. The snow-cleared away at last, so as
to enable the travellers to reach Edinburgh, and there to end
their journey. The intimacy of Foote and Ardwell did not end
here, but continued until the death of Foote.</p>

<p>‘After this period Foote several times visited Scotland: he
always in his writings showed himself partial to Scotland and to
the Scotch. On every visit which he afterwards made to the
northern metropolis, he set apart a night or two for a social
meeting with his friend Ardwell, whose family lived in the second
house from the head of that pretty row of houses more than half-way
down Leith Walk, still called Springfield. In the parlour,
on the right-hand side in entering that house, the largest of the
row, Foote, the celebrated wit of the day, has frequently been
associated with many of the Edinburgh and Leith worthies, when
and where he was wont to keep the table in a roar.</p>

<p>‘The biography of Foote is well known. However, I may
add that Mr Mouat and Mr M’Culloch died much lamented in
the year 1793. David M’Culloch (Wee Davie) died in the year
1824, at Cheltenham, much regretted. For many years he had
resided in India. In consequence of family connection, he became
a familiar visitor at Abbotsford, and a favourite acquaintance of
Sir Walter Scott.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Mr Lockhart tells us that, next to Tom
Moore, Sir Walter thought him the finest warbler he had ever
heard. He was certainly an exquisitely fine singer of Scotch
songs. Sir Walter Scott never heard him sing until he was far
advanced in life, or until his voice had given way to a long
residence in India. Mr Lockhart also tells us that David
M’Culloch in his youth was an intimate and favourite companion
of Burns, and that the poet hardly ventured to publish many of
his songs until he heard them sung by his friend. I will only
add that the writer of this has more than once heard Burns say
that he never fully knew the beauty of his songs until he heard
them sung by David M’Culloch.’</p>

<h2><a name="GABRIELS_ROAD" id="GABRIELS_ROAD">[GABRIEL’S ROAD.</a></h2>


<p>Previous to 1767 the eye of a person perched in a favourable
situation in the Old Town surveyed the whole ground on
which the New Town was afterwards built. Immediately beyond
the North Loch was a range of grass fields called Bearford’s Parks,
from the name of the proprietor, Hepburn of Bearford in East
Lothian. Bounding these on the north, in the line of the subsequent
Princes Street, was a road enclosed by two dry-stone walls,
thence called the Lang Dykes; it was the line by which the
Viscount Dundee rode with his small troop of adherents when
he had ascertained that the Convention was determined to settle
the crown upon the Prince of Orange, and he saw that the only
duty that remained for him was to raise the Highland clans for
King James.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The main mass of ground, originally rough with
whins and broom, but latterly forming what was called Wood’s
Farm, was crossed obliquely by a road extending between Silvermills,
a rural hamlet on the mill-course of the Leith, and the
passage into the Old Town obtained by the dam of the North
Loch at the bottom of Halkerston’s Wynd. There are still some
traces of this road. You see it leave Silvermills behind West
Cumberland Street. Behind Duke Street, on the west side, the
boundary-wall of the Queen Street Garden is oblique in consequence
of its having passed that way. Finally it terminates in a
short, oblique passage behind the Register House, wherein stood
till lately a tall building containing a famous house of resort,
Ambrose’s Tavern. This short passage bore the name of Gabriel’s
Road, and it was supposed to do so in connection with a remarkable
murder, of which it was the scene.</p>

<p>The murderer in the case was in truth a man named Robert
Irvine. He was tutor to two boys, sons of Mr Gordon of Ellon.
In consequence of the children having reported some liberties
they saw him take with their mother’s maid, he conceived the
horrible design of murdering them, and did so one day as he
was leading them for a walk along the rough ground where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
New Town is now situated. The frightful transaction was beheld
from the Castle-hill; he was pursued, taken, and next day but one
hanged by the baron of Broughton, after having his hands hacked
off by the knife with which he had committed the deed. The date
of this off-hand execution was 30th April 1717. Both the date
and the murderer’s name have several times been misstated.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Adjacent to this road, about the spot now occupied by the
Royal Bank, stood a small group of houses called Mutrie’s Hill,
some of which professed to furnish curds and cream and fruits in
their seasons, and were on these accounts resorted to by citizens
and their families on summer evenings. One in particular bore
the name of ‘Peace and Plenty.’</p>

<p>The village of Silvermills, for the sake of which, as an access
to the city, Gabriel’s Road existed, still maintains its place amidst
the streets and crescents of the New Town. It contains a few
houses of a superior cast; but it is a place sadly in want of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacer vates</i>. No notice has ever been taken of it in any of the
books regarding Edinburgh, nor has any attempt ever been made
to account for its somewhat piquant name. I shall endeavour
to do so.</p>

<p>In 1607 silver was found in considerable abundance at Hilderstone,
in Linlithgowshire, on the property of the gentleman who
figures in another part of this volume as Tam o’ the Cowgate.
Thirty-eight barrels of ore were sent to the Mint in the Tower
of London to be tried, and were found to give about twenty-four
ounces of silver for every hundredweight. Expert persons were
placed upon the mine, and mills were erected on the Water of
Leith for the melting and fining of the ore. The sagacious owner
gave the mine the name of <em>God’s Blessing</em>. By-and-by the king
heard of it, and thinking it improper that any such fountain of
wealth should belong to a private person, purchased God’s Blessing
for £5000, that it might be worked upon a larger scale for the
benefit of the public. But somehow, from the time it left the
hands of the original owner, God’s Blessing ceased to be anything
like so fertile as it had been, and in time the king withdrew from
the enterprise a great loser. The Silvermills I conceive to have
been a part of the abandoned plant.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>]</p>

map, in the first volume of <cite>The Old Edinburgh Club Book</cite>. The statement
is therein made ‘that since 1860 two-thirds of the ancient buildings in the Old
Town of Edinburgh have been demolished.’ The map showed, coloured in red,
the remaining buildings of the Old Town which had survived until the beginning
of the twentieth century.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> George, sixth Earl of Huntly, took his last illness, June 1636, in ‘his house
in the Canongate.’ George, the first duke, who had held out the Castle at the
Revolution, died December 1716, at his house in the Citadel of Leith, where he
appears to have occasionally resided for some years. I should suppose the
house on the Castle-hill to have been inhabited by the family in the interval.
</p>
<p>
The Citadel seems to have been a little nest of aristocracy, of the Cavalier
party. In 1745 one of its inhabitants was Dame Magdalen Bruce of Kinross,
widow of the baronet who had assisted in the Restoration. Here lived with
her the Rev. Robert Forbes, Episcopal minister of Leith [afterwards Bishop of
Orkney], from whose collections regarding Charles Edward and his adventures
a volume of extracts was published by me in 1834. [The <cite>Lyon in Mourning</cite> is
here referred to, from which Dr Chambers published a number of the narratives
in his <cite>Jacobite Memoirs</cite> (1834), and from which he also utilised some information
of the Rebellion of 1745 in the preparation of his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>.
At his death he bequeathed the work to the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh,
where it now remains. It consists of eight small octavo volumes of manuscript
of about two hundred pages, each bound in black leather, with blackened
edges, and around the title-page of each volume a deep black border. The
collection was the work of the Rev. Robert Forbes, a clergyman of the
Episcopal Church of Scotland, who became in 1762 Bishop of Ross and Caithness.
It was treasured by his widow for thirty years, and then bought by Sir
Henry Stewart of Allanton in 1806. Dr Robert Chambers unearthed it for
historical purposes, and later purchased it from Sir Henry Stewart. Some relics
which Forbes succeeded in obtaining from his correspondents&mdash;such as a piece
of the Prince’s garter, a piece of the gown he wore as Betty Burke, and of the
string of the apron he then had on, a fragment of a waistcoat worn by the
Prince, and other things&mdash;were preserved on the inside of some of the boards
of the volumes. The <cite>Lyon in Mourning</cite> was edited by Mr Henry Paton
from the manuscript in the Advocates’ Library, and published in three volumes
by the Scottish History Society (1895).] Throughout those troublous days, a
little Episcopal congregation was kept together in Leith; their place of worship
being the <em>first floor</em> of an old, dull-looking house in Queen Street (dated 1615),
the lower floor of which was, in my recollection, a police-office.</p></div>

and two brothers of that name occupied the house. To Brown’s Close the
recently formed Society of Antiquaries of Scotland removed in 1794 from
Gosford’s Close, because the latter was too narrow to admit of the members
being carried to the place of meeting in sedan-chairs.</p></div>

Scotch Church up to £150, many of them were so small that the widow’s
allowance from this fund nearly equalled them. Such was the case of Cranshaws,
a pastoral parish among the Lammermoor Hills. A former minister of
Cranshaws having wooed a lass of humble rank, the father of the lady, when
consulted on the subject, said, ‘Tak’ him, Jenny; he’s as gude deid as living!’
meaning, of course, that she would be as well off as a widow as in the quality
of a wife.</p></div>

a thoroughfare was cut through the garden, making the close the principal
communication between the Lawnmarket and Hanover Street, then the western
extremity of the New Town. The name it first bore was ‘Lady Gray’s Close,’
after the wife of the builder of the house, and that of Lady Stair’s Close was
given to it (<cite>The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club</cite>, vol. iii.) early in the eighteenth
century, when the house passed into the possession of the first Lady Stair, a
granddaughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum. Lord Rosebery, who represents

should see a new coach of a certain colour driven up to her door as belonging
to herself, her hearse must speedily follow. Many years afterwards, Lord

London, of the marriage register of the second Earl of Stair with Lady
Primrose, 27th March 1708. Thus they were married persons several years
before the presumed date of this story. Miss Rosaline Masson announced the
discovery in an article in <cite>Chambers’s Journal</cite> for 1912, entitled, ‘The Secret
Marriage of Lady Primrose and John, Second Earl of Stair.’ She makes this
comment: ‘The testimony of John Waugh, Parson, has lain buried for over
two hundred years in the old Register in the city; but the tale, whispered one
day, some time about the year 1714, in the High Street of Edinburgh, first
among the strutting gallants and loungers at the Cross at noon, and later on,
over the delicate tea-cups, in the gossipy gatherings of the fair sex&mdash;that tale
was nowise buried. It has never died. Did not Kirkpatrick Sharpe repeat it,
sixty years after Lady Stair’s death, to young Robert Chambers, at that time
collecting material for his inimitable book, <cite>Traditions of Edinburgh</cite>?’ The
article further tries to answer the question why the Earl of Stair and the young
widow made this clandestine marriage, which gave opportunity for the story.</p></div>

have this privilege, although they do not exercise it. Probably the custom
introduced by Sir Thomas Hope originated in his being an officer of state,

Seine, and observing that the dirt thrown up by the carriages produced a most
offensive stench, resolved to remedy this intolerable nuisance by causing the
streets to be paved. For a long time swine were permitted to wallow in them;
till the young Philip being killed by a fall from his horse, from a sow running
between its legs, an order was issued that no swine should in future run about
the street. The monks of the Abbey of St Anthony remonstrated fiercely
against this order, alleging that the prevention of the saint’s swine from
enjoying the liberty of going where they pleased was a want of respect to
their patron. It was therefore found necessary to grant them the privilege of
wallowing in the dirt without molestation, requiring the monks only to turn
them out with bells about their necks.</p></div>

was in the first floor of a house near the Cross, above an alley which still bears
the name of the Post-office Close. Thence it was removed to a floor in the
south side of the Parliament Square, which was fitted up like a shop, and the
letters were dealt across an ordinary counter, like other goods. At this time
all the out-of-door business of delivery was managed by one letter-carrier.
About 1745 the London bag brought on one occasion no more than a single letter,
addressed to the British Linen Company. From the Parliament Square the
office was removed to Lord Covington’s house, above described; thence, after
some years, to a house in North Bridge Street; thence to Waterloo Place; and

of Charles II. Tradition assigns the following as the origin of the phrase: An
old gentleman in Fife, designated Durham of Largo, was in the habit, at the
period mentioned, of regulating the time of evening worship by the appearance
of the smoke of Edinburgh, which he could easily see, through the clear summer
twilight, from his own door. When he observed the smoke increase in density,
in consequence of the good folk of the city preparing their supper, he would call
all the family into the house, saying: ‘It’s time now, bairns, to tak’ the beuks,
and gang to our beds, for yonder’s Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht-cap!’</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_137" id="Footnote_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> This gentleman, the ‘revered defender of beauteous Stuart,’ and the surviving
friend of Allan Ramsay, had an unaccountable aversion to cheese, and not
only forbade the appearance of that article upon his table, but also its introduction
into his house. His family, who did not partake in this antipathy,
sometimes smuggled a small quantity of cheese into the house, and ate it in
secret; but he almost always discovered it by the <em>smell</em>, which was the sense
it chiefly offended. Upon scenting the object of his disgust, he would start up
and run distractedly through the house in search of it, and not compose himself
again to his studies till it was thrown out of doors. Some of his ingenious
children, by way of a joke, once got into their possession the coat with which
he usually went to the court, and ripping up the sutures of one of its wide, old-fashioned
skirts, sewed up therein a considerable slice of double Gloster. Mr
Tytler was next day surprised when, sitting near the bar, he perceived the
smell of cheese rising around him. ‘Cheese here too!’ cried the querulous old
gentleman; ‘nay, then, the whole world must be conspiring against me!’ So
saying, he rose, and ran home to tell his piteous case to Mrs Tytler and the
children, who became convinced from this that he really possessed the singular
delicacy and fastidiousness in respect of the effluvia arising from cheese which
they formerly thought to be fanciful.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_142" id="Footnote_142"></a><a href="#FNanchor_142"><span class="label">[142]</span></a> The following were other eighteenth century Edinburgh clubs:
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Poker Club</span> originated in a combination of gentlemen favourable to
the establishment of militia in Scotland, and its name, happily hit on by
Professor Adam Ferguson, was selected to avoid giving offence to the Government.
A history of the club is given in Dugald Stewart’s Life, and also in
Carlyle’s <cite>Autobiography</cite>, where he says: ‘Dinner was on the table soon after
two o’clock, at one shilling a head, the wine to be confined to sherry and claret,
and the reckoning called at six o’clock.’ The minutes of this interesting club
are preserved in the University Library.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Mirror Club</span>, formed by the contributors to the periodical of that
name. It had really existed before under the name of ‘The Tabernacle.’ ‘The
Tabernacle,’ or ‘The Feast of Tabernacles,’ as Ramsay of Ochtertyre calls it,
was a company of friends and admirers of Henry Dundas, first Viscount
Melville.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Easy Club</span>, founded by Allan Ramsay the poet, consisted of twelve
members, each of whom was required to assume the name of some Scottish
poet. Ramsay took that of Gawin Douglas.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Capillaire Club</span> was ‘composed of all who were inclined to be witty
and joyous.’
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Facer Club</span>, which met in Lucky Wood’s tavern in the Canongate,
was perhaps not of a high order. If a member did not drain his measure of
liquor, he had to throw it at his own face.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Griskin Club</span> also met in the Canongate. Dr Carlyle and those who
took part with him in the production of Home’s <cite>Douglas</cite> at the Canongate
playhouse formed this club, and gave it its name from the pork griskins which
was their favourite supper dish.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Ruffian Club</span>, ‘composed of men whose hearts were milder than their
manners, and their principles more correct than their habits of life.’
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Wagering Club</span>, instituted in 1775, still meets annually. An account
of this club is given in <cite>The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club</cite>, vol. ii.
</p>
<p>
Others may be mentioned by name only: <span class="smcap">The Diversorium</span>, <span class="smcap">The Haveral</span>,
<span class="smcap">The Whin Bush</span>, <span class="smcap">The Skull</span>, <span class="smcap">The Six Foot</span>, <span class="smcap">The Assembly of Birds</span>,
<span class="smcap">The Card</span>, <span class="smcap">The Borached</span>, <span class="smcap">The Humdrum</span>, <span class="smcap">The Apician</span>, <span class="smcap">The Blast
and Quaff</span>, <span class="smcap">The Ocean</span>, <span class="smcap">The Pipe</span>, <span class="smcap">The Knights of the Cap and
Feather</span>, <span class="smcap">The Revolutionary</span>, <span class="smcap">The Stoic</span>, and <span class="smcap">The Club</span>, referred to
in Lockhart’s <cite>Life of Scott</cite>.
</p>
<p>
Of a later period than those mentioned above were <span class="smcap">The Gowks Club</span>;
<span class="smcap">The Right and Wrong</span>, of which James Hogg gives a short account; and
<span class="smcap">The Friday Club</span>, instituted by Lord Cockburn, who also wrote an interesting
history of it, recently printed by Mr H. A. Cockburn, in vol. iii. of <cite>The Book

epitaph for Ned Burke, stating that he died in Edinburgh in November 1751.
He also gives the following particulars from Burke’s conversation:
</p>
<p>
‘One of the soles of Ned’s shoes happening to come off, Ned cursed the day
upon which he should be forced to go without shoes. The Prince, hearing him,
called to him and said: “Ned, look at me”&mdash;when (said Ned) I saw him holding
up one of his feet at me, where there was de’il a sole upon the shoe; and
then I said: “Oh, my dear! I have nothing more to say. You have stopped
my mouth indeed.”
</p>
<p>
‘When Ned was talking of seeing the Prince again, he spoke these words:
“If the Prince do not come and see me soon, good faith I will go and see my
daughter [Charles having taken the name of Betty Burke when in a female
disguise], and crave her; for she has not yet paid her christening money, and
as little has she paid the coat I ga’e her in her greatest need.”’</p></div>

had stood past the memory of man, to a place beneath in the High Street,

next month, defending the fashion as elegant and of some account in coquetry.
Almost all the old ladies who survived the commencement of this century took
snuff. Some kept it in pouches, and abandoned, for its sake, the wearing of
white ruffles and handkerchiefs.</p></div>

in Ross House, a suburban mansion, which afterwards was used as a lying-in

Square. While in Mr Lockhart’s possession Ross House was the scene of
many gay routs and balls.

<p>
The Lords Ross, the original proprietors of this mansion, died out in 1754.
One of the last persons in Scotland supposed to be possessed by an evil spirit
was a daughter of George, the second last lord. A correspondent says: ‘A
person alive in 1824 told me that, when a child, he saw her clamber up to the
top of an old-fashioned four-post bed like a cat. In her fits it was almost
impossible to hold her. About the same time, a daughter of Lord Kinnaird
was supposed to have the second-sight. One day, during divine worship in
the High Church, she fainted away; on her recovery, she declared that when
Lady Janet Dundas (a daughter of Lord Lauderdale) entered the pew with
Miss Dundas, who was a beautiful young girl, she saw the latter as it were in
a shroud gathered round her neck, and upon her head. Miss Dundas died a
short time after.’</p></div>

after several minor diplomatic appointments on the Continent, was the representative
of Great Britain at the court of St Petersburg. An interesting
sketch of him, under the title of ‘Felix,’ by Mrs Cockburn, is appended to the
volume of that lady’s <cite>Letters</cite>, edited by Mr T. Craig Brown. Miss Keith,
known to Edinburgh society as ‘Sister Anne,’ was Scott’s ‘Mrs Bethune
Balliol’ of the <cite>Chronicles of the Canongate</cite>. This gentleman was absent from
Edinburgh about twenty-two years, and returned at a time when it was supposed
that manners were beginning to exhibit symptoms of great improvement.
He, however, complained that they were degenerated. In his early
time, he said, every Scottish gentleman of £300 a year travelled abroad when
young, and brought home to the bosom of domestic life, and to the profession
in which it might be his fate to engage, a vast fund of literary information,
knowledge of the world, and genuine good manners, which dignified his character
through life. But towards the year 1770 this practice had been entirely
given up, and in consequence a sensible change was discoverable upon the
face of good society. (See the <cite>Life of John Home</cite>, by Henry Mackenzie, Esq.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_196" id="Footnote_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> It is curious to observe how, in correspondence with the change in our
manners and customs, one trade has become extinct, while another succeeded
in its place. At the end of the sixteenth century the manufacture of offensive
weapons predominated over all other trades in Edinburgh. We had then
cutlers, whose <em>essay-piece</em>, on being admitted of the corporation, was ‘ane plain
finished quhanzear’ or sword; gaird-makers, whose business consisted in
fashioning sword-handles; Dalmascars, who gilded the said weapon; and belt-makers,
who wrought the girdles that bound it to the wearer’s body. There
were also dag-makers, who made hackbuts (short-guns) and dags (pistols).
These various professions all became associated in the general one of armourers,
or gunsmiths, when the wearing of weapons went into desuetude&mdash;there being
then no further necessity for the expedition and expediency of the modern
political economist’s boasted ‘division of labour.’ As the above arts gave way,
those which tended to provide the comforts and luxuries of civilised life gradually
arose. About 1586 we find the first notice of locksmiths in Edinburgh, and
there was then only one of the trade, whose essay was simply ‘a kist lock.’
In 1609, however, as the security of property increased, the essay was ‘a kist
lock and a hingand bois lock, with an double plate lock;’ and in 1644 ‘a key
and sprent band’ were added to the essay. In 1682 ‘a cruik and cruik band’
were further added; and in 1728, for the safety of the lieges, the locksmith’s
essay was appointed to be ‘a cruik and cruik band, a pass lock with a round
filled bridge, not cut or broke in the backside, with nobs and jamb bound.’ In
1595 we find the first notice of shearsmiths. In 1609 a heckle-maker was
admitted into the Corporation of Hammermen. In 1613 a tinkler makes his
appearance; Thomas Duncan, the first tinkler, was then admitted. Pewterers
are mentioned so far back as 1588. In 1647 we find the first knock-maker
(<em>clock-maker</em>), but so limited was his business that he was also a locksmith.
In 1664 the first white-iron man was admitted; also the first harness-maker,
though lorimers had previously existed. Paul Martin, a distressed French
Protestant, in 1691, was the first manufacturer of surgical instruments in
Edinburgh. In 1720 we find the first pin-maker; in 1764, the first edge-tool
maker and first fish-hook maker.</p></div>

belonging to the Corporation of Hammermen. It was erected immediately
before the Reformation by a pious citizen, Michael Macquhan, and Jonet
Rhynd, his widow, whose tomb is shown in the floor. The windows towards
the south were anciently filled with stained glass; and there still remain some
specimens of that kind of ornament, which, by some strange chance, had
survived the Reformation. In a large department at the top of one window
are the arms of Mary of Guise, who was queen-regent at the time the chapel
was built. The arms of Macquhan and his wife are also to be seen. In the
lower panes, which have been filled with small figures of saints, only one
remains&mdash;a St Bartholomew&mdash;who, by a rare chance, has survived the general
massacre. The whole is now very carefully preserved. When the distinguished
Reformer, John Craig, returned to Scotland at the Reformation, after an
absence of twenty-four years, he preached for some time in this chapel, in the
Latin language, to a select congregation of the learned, being unable, by long
disuse, to hold forth in his vernacular tongue. This divine subsequently was
appointed a colleague to John Knox, and is distinguished in history for having
refused to publish the banns between Queen Mary and Bothwell, and also for
having written the National Covenant in 1589. Another circumstance in the
history of this chapel is worthy of notice. The body of the Earl of Argyll,
after his execution, June 30, 1685, was brought down and deposited in this
place, to wait till it should be conveyed to the family burying-place at Kilmun.</p></div>

Jarnowick, was a native of Palermo. About 1770 he went to Paris, where he
performed a concerto of his famous master Lolli, but did not succeed. He then
played one of his own concertos, that in A major, and became quite the fashion.
The style of Giornovicki was highly elegant and finished, his intonation perfect,
and his taste pure. The late Domenico Dragonetti, one of the best judges in
Europe, told me that Giornovicki was the most elegant and graceful violin-player
he had ever heard before Paganini, but that he wanted power. He
seems to have been a dissipated and passionate man; a good swordsman too,
as was common in those days. One day, in a dispute, he struck the Chevalier
St George, then one of the greatest violin-players and best swordsmen in
Europe. St George said coolly: “I have too much regard for his musical
talent to fight him.” A noble speech, showing St George in all respects the
better man. Giornovicki died suddenly at St Petersburg in 1804.’&mdash;G. F. G.]</p></div>

much humour,’ which he sometimes accompanied with a key and tongs. Sir
Gilbert Elliot, who played the German flute, was the first to introduce that
instrument to a Scottish audience. St Cecilia’s Hall has passed through many
vicissitudes since then, and is now a bookbinder’s warehouse, but its fine
ceiling and the orchestral balcony at the southern end are still preserved as

help your ticket, for I have the Lady Directress’s permission to lead down the

before going out to an evening-party, and at a time when hairdressers and
peruke-makers were much in demand, requested a servant (newly come home)
to tell Tam Tough the hairdresser to come to her immediately. The servant
departed in quest of Puff, but had scarcely reached the street before she forgot
the barber’s name. Meeting with a caddy, she asked him if he knew where the
hairdresser lived. “Whatna hairdresser is ’t?” replied the caddy. “I ha’e

Donald. “As near as I can mind,” said the girl, “it was a name that wad

that an aged woman of the name of Peggie Forbes, who had been a servant with
Dugald Stewart, well remembered his lordship when under the professor’s roof
in early days. Interested in the circumstance, Lord Palmerston took occasion
to pay her a visit at her dwelling, No. 1 Rankeillor Street, and expressed his
pleasure at renewing the acquaintance of the old domestic. Dr John Brown
had discovered the existence of this old association, and with it a box of tools
which were the property of ‘young Maister Henry’ of those days. The sight
of them called up within the breast of the Premier further associations of days

inhabited, by a retired seaman of Admiral Vernon’s squadron, who gave it this
name in commemoration of the triumph which his commander there gained
over the Spaniards in 1739. There must have been various houses at the spot
in 1753, when we find one ‘George Hamilton, in Portobello,’ advertising in the
<cite>Edinburgh Courant</cite> that he would give a reward of three pounds to any one
who should discover the author of a scandalous report, which represented him
as harbouring robbers in his house. The waste upon which Portobello is now
partly founded was dreadfully infested at this time with robbers, and resorted
to by smugglers; see <cite>Courant</cite>. [Portobello, while remaining one of the ‘Leith

consider the National Covenant, which was presented to the public next day
in the Greyfriars Church. We are informed by the Earl of Rothes, in his

part, that some few objected to certain points in it; but being taken aside into

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 title="Section 3. The Project Gutenberg Literary">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
